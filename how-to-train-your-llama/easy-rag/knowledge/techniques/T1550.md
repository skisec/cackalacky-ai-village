# Use Alternate Authentication Material (T1550)

## Description
Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls. 

Authentication processes generally require a valid identity (e.g., username) along with one or more authentication factors (e.g., password, pin, physical smart card, token generator, etc.). Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.

Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s). Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through Credential Access (TA0006) techniques. By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors.


## Sub-techniques

- Web Session Cookie (T1550.004)
- Pass the Hash (T1550.002)
- Application Access Token (T1550.001)

## Tactics
- Defense Evasion (TA0005)
- Lateral Movement (TA0008)

## Mitigations
- Audit (M1047)
- Password Policies (M1027)
- Account Use Policies (M1036)
- Privileged Account Management (M1026)
- Active Directory Configuration (M1015)
- Application Developer Guidance (M1013)
- User Account Management (M1018)

## Detection
Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services. Look for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Look for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.

#### Active Directory: Active Directory Credential Request (DS0026): 
Monitor requests of new ticket granting ticket or service tickets to a Domain Controller, such as Windows EID 4769 or 4768, that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.

#### Web Credential: Web Credential Usage (DS0006): 
Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource by providing web credentials (ex: Windows EID 1202) that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.

#### User Account: User Account Authentication (DS0002): 
Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.
