# Content Injection (T1659)

## Description
Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., Drive-by Target (T1608.004) followed by Drive-by Compromise (T1189)), adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)) and other data to already compromised systems.

Adversaries may inject content to victim systems in various ways, including:

* From the middle, where the adversary is in-between legitimate online client-server communications (**Note:** this is similar but distinct from Adversary-in-the-Middle (T1557), which describes AiTM activity solely within an enterprise environment) 
* From the side, where malicious content is injected and races to the client as a fake response to requests of a legitimate online server 

Content injection is often the result of compromised upstream communication channels, for example at the level of an internet service provider (ISP) as is the case with "lawful interception."

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor for other unusual network traffic that may indicate additional malicious content transferred to the system. Use network intrusion detection systems, sometimes with SSL/TLS inspection, to look for known malicious payloads, content obfuscation, and exploit code.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Content Injection in Network Traffic

``` (EventCode=3)
OR (source="zeek_http_logs" response_code IN (302, 307) AND url IN (malicious_redirect_list))
OR (source="proxy_logs" response_body_content IN (suspicious_script_list))
| eval risk_score=case(
    response_code=302 AND url IN (malicious_redirect_list), 9,
    response_body_content IN (suspicious_script_list), 8,
    url LIKE "%@%", 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, user, url, response_code, risk_score```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Look for behaviors on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behaviors of browser processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of Process Injection (T1055) for attempts to hide execution, or evidence of Discovery.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Malicious Process Execution from Injected Content

```(EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (parent_process IN ("chrome.exe", "firefox.exe", "edge.exe", "safari.exe", "iexplore.exe"))
| where (process_name IN ("powershell.exe", "cmd.exe", "wget", "curl", "bash", "python"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    process_name IN ("powershell.exe", "cmd.exe"), 9,
    process_name IN ("wget", "curl"), 8,
    parent_process IN ("chrome.exe", "firefox.exe"), 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, user, process_name, parent_process, risk_score ```

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for unexpected and abnormal file creations that may indicate malicious content injected through online network communications.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Malicious File Creation via Content Injection

```(EventCode=11 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_type IN ("exe", "dll", "js", "vbs", "ps1", "sh", "php"))
| where (process_path="C:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\*" OR process_path="/tmp/*" OR process_path="/var/tmp/*")
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(file_name, "%.exe"), 8,
    like(file_name, "%.js"), 9,
    like(file_name, "%.sh"), 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_name, process_path, risk_score ```
