# Cloud Secrets Management Stores (T1555.006)

## Description
Adversaries may acquire credentials from cloud-native secret management solutions such as AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Terraform Vault.  

Secrets managers support the secure centralized management of passwords, API keys, and other credential material. Where secrets managers are in use, cloud services can dynamically acquire credentials via API requests rather than accessing secrets insecurely stored in plain text files or environment variables.  

If an adversary is able to gain sufficient privileges in a cloud environment – for example, by obtaining the credentials of high-privileged Cloud Accounts (T1078.004) or compromising a service that has permission to retrieve secrets – they may be able to request secrets from the secrets manager. This can be accomplished via commands such as `get-secret-value` in AWS, `gcloud secrets describe` in GCP, and `az key vault secret show` in Azure.

**Note:** this technique is distinct from Cloud Instance Metadata API (T1552.005) in that the credentials are being directly requested from the cloud secrets manager, rather than through the medium of the instance metadata API.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Cloud Service: Cloud Service Enumeration (DS0025): 
Monitor for API calls and CLI commands that attempt to enumerate and fetch credential material from the secrets manager, such as `get-secret-value` in AWS, `gcloud secrets describe` in GCP, and `az key vault secret show` in Azure. Alert on any suspicious usages of these commands, such as an account or service generating an unusually high number of secret requests.

Analytic 1 - High volume of secret requests from unusual accounts or services.

``` index=cloud_logs sourcetype IN ("aws:cloudtrail", "gcp:logging", "azure:activity")
(eventName IN ("GetSecretValue", "gcloud secrets describe", "az key vault secret show"))
| eval User=coalesce(userIdentity.arn, protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail, claims.user)
| eval Service=coalesce(eventSource, protoPayload.serviceName, claims.aud)
| eval AccountType=case(
    match(User, "root|admin|superuser"), "High-Privilege",
    match(User, "serviceaccount|svc|automation"), "Service-Account",
    true(), "Standard-User"
)
| eval Platform=case(
    sourcetype=="aws:cloudtrail", "AWS",
    sourcetype=="gcp:logging", "GCP",
    sourcetype=="azure:activity", "Azure",
    true(), "Unknown"
)
| where AccountType != "High-Privilege"``` 

Analytic 2 - Cloud Service Enumeration 

```  index=cloud_logs sourcetype IN ("aws:cloudtrail", "gcp:logging", "azure:activity") | search (sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" eventName="GetSecretValue" 
          OR sourcetype="gcp:pubsub:message" methodName="google.iam.credentials.v1.*" 
          OR sourcetype="azure:eventhub" operationName="Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/read")```
