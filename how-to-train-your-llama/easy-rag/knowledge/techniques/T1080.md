# Taint Shared Content (T1080)

## Description

Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.

A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It uses Shortcut Modification (T1547.009) of directory .LNK files that use Masquerading (T1036) to look like the real directories, which are hidden through Hidden Files and Directories (T1564.001). The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts. 

Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.

## Detection
Processes that write or overwrite many files to a network shared directory may be suspicious. Monitor processes that are executed from removable media for malicious or abnormal activity such as network connections due to Command and Control and possible network Discovery techniques.

Frequently scan shared network directories for malicious files, hidden files, .LNK files, and other file types that may not typical exist in directories used to share specific types of content.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Share: Network Share Access (DS0033): 
Monitor for unexpected and abnormal accesses to network shares, especially those also associated with file activity. Monitor access to shared network directories to detect unauthorized or suspicious access, especially from unfamiliar accounts or at unusual times.
Identify potential attempts to access hidden files or unusual file types within the directory.

``` sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=5145
| search ObjectType="File"
| stats count by ShareName, AccountName, AccessMask, SourceIPAddress, _time
| eval access_suspicious=if(match(ShareName, "\\hidden_directory\\") AND AccessMask="0x2", "suspicious", "normal")
| where access_suspicious="suspicious"
| table _time, ShareName, AccountName, AccessMask, SourceIPAddress, access_suspicious```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor processes that are executed from removable media for malicious or abnormal activity such as network connections due to Command and Control and possible network Discovery techniques.

``` sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventID=1 OR sourcetype="linux:audit" syscall="execve"
| search ParentImage IN ("\\network_share\\*.exe", "\\network_share\\*.bat")
| stats count by Image, ParentImage, AccountName, CommandLine, _time
| eval exec_suspicious=if(match(ParentImage, "\\network_share\\") AND AccountName!="known_service_account", "suspicious", "normal")
| where exec_suspicious="suspicious"```

#### File: File Modification (DS0022): 
Monitor for files that write or overwrite many files to a network shared directory may be suspicious.Track file modification events in shared directories, especially modifications that alter executables or scripts. Monitor for signs of binary tampering, such as changes to .DLL or .EXE files that were previously trusted. Look for metadata changes, such as new authors or timestamps inconsistent with expected changes.

```sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4663 OR sourcetype="linux:audit" syscall="write"
| search ObjectType="File" AccessMask="0x2"
| stats count by ObjectName, AccountName, ProcessName, SourceIPAddress, _time
| eval modification_suspicious=if(match(ObjectName, "\\.exe$|\\.dll$|\\.lnk$") AND ProcessName!="approved_tool.exe", "suspicious", "normal")
| where modification_suspicious="suspicious" ``` 

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for newly constructed files from files that write or overwrite many files to a network shared directory may be suspicious. Monitor for the creation of hidden files and directories that may be used to conceal malicious files or scripts on shared network locations.

``` sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4663 OR sourcetype="linux:audit" syscall IN ("creat", "open")
| search ObjectType="File" AccessMask="0x2" // 0x2 indicates write access
| stats count by ObjectName, AccountName, ProcessName, SourceIPAddress, _time
| eval suspicious=if(match(ObjectName, "\\.exe$|\\.lnk$|\\.scr$|\\.bat$|\\.vbs$") AND AccountName!="known_admin_user", "suspicious", "normal")```
