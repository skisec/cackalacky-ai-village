# Drive-by Compromise (T1189)

## Description
Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e., Drive-by Target (T1608.004)), including:

* A legitimate website is compromised, allowing adversaries to inject malicious code
* Script files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversary
* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers (i.e., Malvertising (T1583.008))
* Built-in web application interfaces that allow user-controllable content are leveraged for the insertion of malicious scripts or iFrames (e.g., cross-site scripting)

Browser push notifications may also be abused by adversaries and leveraged for malicious code injection via User Execution (T1204). By clicking "allow" on browser push notifications, users may be granting a website permission to run JavaScript code on their browser.

Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or a particular region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.

Typical drive-by compromise process:

1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting, notifications, or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.
4. If exploitation is successful, the adversary will gain code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place. In some cases, a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.

Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190), the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.

## Detection
Firewalls and proxies can inspect URLs for potentially known-bad domains or parameters. They can also do reputation-based analytics on websites and their requested resources such as how old a domain is, who it's registered to, if it's on a known bad list, or how many other users have connected to it before.

Network intrusion detection systems, sometimes with SSL/TLS inspection, can be used to look for known malicious scripts (recon, heap spray, and browser identification scripts have been frequently reused), common script obfuscation, and exploit code.

Detecting compromise based on the drive-by exploit from a legitimate website may be difficult. Also look for behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of browser processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of Process Injection (T1055) for attempts to hide execution, evidence of Discovery, or other unusual network traffic that may indicate additional tools transferred to the system.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Firewalls and proxies can inspect URLs for potentially known-bad domains or parameters. They can also do reputation-based analytics on websites and their requested resources such as how old a domain is, who it's registered to, if it's on a known bad list, or how many other users have connected to it before.

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Detect suspicious script execution over HTTP/S. Identify JavaScript payloads with obfuscation or encoded execution. Look for exploit attempts in network payloads.

``` (EventCode=5156 dest_port=80 OR dest_port=443 process="chrome.exe" OR process="firefox.exe")
OR (source="/var/log/zeek/http.log" method="GET" uri IN (suspicious_js_files))
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, uri, user_agent
| where count > 3```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Look for behaviors on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behaviors of browser processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of Process Injection (T1055) for attempts to hide execution, or evidence of Discovery.

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for newly constructed files written to disk to gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. Detect browser process dropping files in suspicious locations (AppData, Temp, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`). Identify exploit payloads (DLLs, JavaScript, shell scripts) written by the browser process.

```(sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=11 Image="C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe" OR Image="C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe")
OR (sourcetype="/var/log/audit/audit.log" SYSCALL="open" path="/tmp/%" process="firefox" OR process="chrome")
| eval risk_score = case(
    like(path, "%\\Temp\\%"), 5,
    like(path, "%AppData%"), 4,
    like(path, "%/var/tmp%"), 6
)
| where risk_score >= 5
| table _time, host, process, path, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections to untrusted hosts that are used to send or receive data. Identify browser processes initiating connections to known malicious domains.
Detect browser requests to suspicious IPs or domains classified under newly registered domains.
Look for anomalous DNS queries and HTTP request patterns.

```(sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=3 process="chrome.exe" OR process="firefox.exe")
OR (source="cloud_dns_logs" category="newly_registered_domain")
OR (source="/var/log/zeek/conn.log" dest_ip IN (malicious_ip_list))
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, domain, process
| where count > 5 ```
