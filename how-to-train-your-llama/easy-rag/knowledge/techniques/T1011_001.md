# Exfiltration Over Bluetooth (T1011.001)

## Description
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over Bluetooth rather than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an adversary may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.

Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access and proximity. Bluetooth connections might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.

## Parent Technique
- Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium (T1011)

## Tactics
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

## Mitigations
- Disable or Remove Feature or Program (M1042)
- Operating System Configuration (M1028)

## Detection
Monitor for processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before. Processes that normally require user-driven events to access the network (for example, a web browser opening with a mouse click or key press) but access the network without such may be malicious.

Monitor for and investigate changes to host adapter settings, such as addition and/or replication of communication interfaces.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows., such as the usage of abnormal/unexpected protocols.

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor commands enabling Bluetooth interfaces (rfkill unblock bluetooth, btmgmt power on), execution of Bluetooth file transfer utilities (bluetoothctl, l2ping, hcitool).

Analytic 1 - Detecting Bluetooth Activation Commands 

```(EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("rfkill unblock bluetooth", "bluetoothctl power on", "btmgmt power on", "hciconfig hci0 up"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("rfkill unblock bluetooth", "btmgmt power on"), 9,
    command IN ("bluetoothctl power on", "hciconfig hci0 up"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score ```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor file access events in directories commonly used for data staging (/tmp, C:\Users\Public\), files copied to Bluetooth shared folders, or high-volume file reads or writes before network activity.

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Access Before Bluetooth Exfiltration 

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "/media/bluetooth/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_path IN ("/media/bluetooth/*"), 9,
    file_path IN ("/var/tmp/*"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor high-volume data transfers over Bluetooth, Bluetooth PAN being used to route exfiltrated data, or Unusual Bluetooth protocol usage on enterprise endpoints.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Large Data Exfiltration via Bluetooth

``` (EventCode=3)
OR (source="zeek_conn.log" protocol="bluetooth" bytes_out > 5000000)
OR (source="firewall_logs" protocol="bluetooth" bytes_out > 10000000)
| eval risk_score=case(
    bytes_out > 10000000, 9,
    bytes_out > 5000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, dest_device, bytes_out, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for unusual Bluetooth device pairings, inbound or outbound Bluetooth connections from unexpected processes, or unexpected activation of Bluetooth Personal Area Network (PAN) services.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Unauthorized Bluetooth Network Connections

```(EventCode=3 OR EventCode=10400)
OR (source="zeek_conn.log" interface IN ("bt0"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    interface IN ("bt0"), 9,
    process_name IN ("bluetoothctl", "bttransfer"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, interface, dest_device, risk_score ```
