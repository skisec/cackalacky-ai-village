# Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation (T1621)

## Description
Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.

Adversaries in possession of credentials to Valid Accounts (T1078) may be unable to complete the login process if they lack access to the 2FA or MFA mechanisms required as an additional credential and security control. To circumvent this, adversaries may abuse the automatic generation of push notifications to MFA services such as Duo Push, Microsoft Authenticator, Okta, or similar services to have the user grant access to their account. If adversaries lack credentials to victim accounts, they may also abuse automatic push notification generation when this option is configured for self-service password reset (SSPR).

In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request in response to “MFA fatigue.”

## Detection
Monitor user account logs as well as 2FA/MFA application logs for suspicious events: unusual login attempt source location, mismatch in location of login attempt and smart device receiving 2FA/MFA request prompts, and high volume of repeated login attempts, all of which may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised minus 2FA/MFA mechanism.

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Metadata (DS0028): 
Monitor 2FA/MFA application logs for suspicious events such as unusual login attempt source location, mismatch in location of login attempt and smart device approving 2FA/MFA request prompts.

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor application logs for suspicious events including repeated MFA failures that may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised.

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor 2FA/MFA application logs for suspicious events such as rapid login attempts with valid credentials.
