# Cloud Administration Command (T1651)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse cloud management services to execute commands within virtual machines. Resources such as AWS Systems Manager, Azure RunCommand, and Runbooks allow users to remotely run scripts in virtual machines by leveraging installed virtual machine agents. 

If an adversary gains administrative access to a cloud environment, they may be able to abuse cloud management services to execute commands in the environmentâ€™s virtual machines. Additionally, an adversary that compromises a service provider or delegated administrator account may similarly be able to leverage a Trusted Relationship (T1199) to execute commands in connected virtual machines.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for suspicious command executions via cloud management services like AWS System Manager or Azure RunCommand. In Azure, usage of Azure RunCommand can be identified via the Azure Activity Logs, and additional details on the result of  executed jobs are available in the `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows` directory on Windows virtual machines.

Analytic 1 - Abnormal or unauthorized execution of commands/scripts on VMs

``` index=cloud_logs sourcetype=aws:ssm OR sourcetype=azure:activity
| search action IN ("RunCommand", "StartSSMCommand", "ExecuteCommand")
```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for process creation events in virtual machines that are associated with cloud VM agents, such as the WindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe process on Azure virtual machines. 

Analytic 1 - Unexpected process creation

``` sourcetype=process_creation
| search process_name IN ("WindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe", "ssm-agent.exe")
| where process_name IN ("WindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe", "ssm-agent.exe") AND process_path != "/usr/local/bin/"
```

#### Script: Script Execution (DS0012): 
Monitor the execution of scripts within virtual machines, especially those initiated via cloud management services like Azure RunCommand. In Azure, usage of Azure RunCommand can be identified via the Azure Activity Logs, and additional details on the result of  executed jobs are available in the `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows` directory on Windows virtual machines.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized script execution

``` sourcetype=azure:activity
| search script_name IN ("script.sh", "run.ps1", "start.cmd")
| where script_name IN ("script.sh", "run.ps1", "start.cmd") AND user NOT IN ("known_admins")
```
