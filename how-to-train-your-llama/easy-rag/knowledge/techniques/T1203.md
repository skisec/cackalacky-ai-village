# Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)

## Description
Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.

Several types exist:

### Browser-based Exploitation

Web browsers are a common target through Drive-by Compromise (T1189) and Spearphishing Link (T1566.002). Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.

### Office Applications

Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through Phishing (T1566). Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.

### Common Third-party Applications

Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.

## Detection
Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Also look for behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of the browser or Office processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of Process Injection (T1055) for attempts to hide execution, evidence of Discovery, or other unusual network traffic that may indicate additional tools transferred to the system.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Identify abnormal child processes spawned by applications commonly targeted by exploits, such as browsers or Office programs, particularly those launched with suspicious arguments or into unknown directories.

Example, it is not expected behavior for print spool service to be executing discovery type processes. However, this is one example and could be any number of native or third party processes that are executing either unusual or unknown (potentially adversary brought) processes.

Note:
- Analytic 1, look for instances where Office Applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) are launched with suspicious parameters or from unusual locations
- Analytic 2, look for abnormal child process creation by Office Applications especially when accompanied by suspicious command-line parameters

Analytic 1 - Office Application Process Execution

``` (source="*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="*WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND (Image= “\winword.exe” OR Image= “\excel.exe” OR Image= “*\powerpnt.exe”) AND (CommandLine= “*macro*” OR CommandLine= “*automation*” OR CommandLine= “*shellcode*”) AND ParentCommandLine= “*open*”```

Analytic 2 - Unusual Child Process Creation

``` (source="*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="*WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND (ParentImage= “\winword.exe” OR ParentImage= “\excel.exe” OR ParentImage= “\powerpnt.exe”) AND (Image != “\system32\” OR Image != “*\program files”)```

#### File: File Modification (DS0022): 
Monitor file system changes associated with exploitation, such as suspicious files dropped by browsers, Office apps, or third-party programs, which can be used for further stages of attack.

Analytic 1 - identifies file creations or modifications associated with commonly exploited software

```sourcetype=linux_auditd
| search file_path IN ("/Users/*/Library/", "C:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\", "/home/*/.config/", "/var/tmp/")
| stats count by file_path process_name user
| where process_name IN ("chrome.exe", "firefox.exe", "winword.exe", "excel.exe", "acrord32.exe", "flashplayer.exe") ```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor log entries from browsers, Office applications, and third-party applications for suspicious behavior, such as crashes, abnormal terminations, or instability that could indicate an attempted exploit.

Analytic 1 - logs related to application crashes or unexpected behavior, which could signal an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.

```sourcetype=WinEventLog:Application EventCode=1000
| search application IN ("chrome.exe", "firefox.exe", "winword.exe", "excel.exe", "acrord32.exe", "flashplayer.exe")
| stats count by application event_description
| where event_description IN ("crash", "instability", "unexpected termination") ``` 

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Look for unusual outbound connections following abnormal process execution, as this could indicate an adversary has established a foothold and is initiating communication with C2 infrastructure.

Analytic 1 - monitors for network traffic generated by exploited processes

``` sourcetype=network_flow OR (sourcetype=Sysmon AND EventCode=3)
| search process_name IN ("chrome.exe", "firefox.exe", "winword.exe", "excel.exe", "acrord32.exe", "flashplayer.exe")
| stats count by src_ip dest_ip dest_port process_name
| where dest_ip NOT IN ("<known_good_ips>")```
