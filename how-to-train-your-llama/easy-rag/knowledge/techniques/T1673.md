# Virtual Machine Discovery (T1673)

## Description
An adversary may attempt to enumerate running virtual machines (VMs) after gaining access to a host or hypervisor. For example, adversaries may enumerate a list of VMs on an ESXi hypervisor using a Hypervisor CLI (T1059.012) such as `esxcli` or `vim-cmd` (e.g. `esxcli vm process list or vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms`). Adversaries may also directly leverage a graphical user interface, such as VMware vCenter, in order to view virtual machines on a host. 

Adversaries may use the information from Virtual Machine Discovery (T1673) during discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Subsequently discovered VMs may be leveraged for follow-on activities such as Service Stop (T1489) or Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486).

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor command-line arguments that may involve listing virtual machines. On ESXi hosts, monitor for commands such as `esxcli vm process list` or `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms`. 

Analytic 1 - Command Execution (ESXi) 

``` index=esxi_logs sourcetype=shell_log
(command="*esxcli vm process list*" OR command="*vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms*")
| stats count by host, user, command, _time
| where user != "expected_admin_user" OR like(command, "%unexpected_path%")
| sort -_time
``` 

Analytic 1 - Command Execution (Linux/macOS)

``` sourcetype=auditd OR sourcetype=sysmon
(process_name IN ("virsh", "VBoxManage", "qemu-img") AND command="*list*" OR command="*info*")
| stats count by host, user, command, parent_process_name, _time
| where user!="root" AND NOT match(command, "known_admin_script")
| sort -_time
``` 

Analytic 1 - Command Execution (Windows - Hyper-V or VMWare Workstation)

```sourcetype=WinEventLog:Sysmon EventCode=1
(Image="*powershell.exe" OR Image="*vmrun.exe" OR Image="*VBoxManage.exe") 
(CommandLine="*Get-VM*" OR CommandLine="*list vms*")
| stats count by host, user, Image, CommandLine, ParentImage, _time
| where user!="expected_admin" AND NOT match(CommandLine, "routine_script.ps1")
| sort -_time
```
