# Botnet (T1584.005)

## Description
Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnetÂ that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems. Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale Phishing (T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

## Parent Technique

- Axiom (G0001)
- Sandworm Team (G0034)
- Volt Typhoon (G1017)

## Mitigations
- Pre-compromise (M1056)

## Detection
Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Phishing (T1566), Endpoint Denial of Service (T1499), or Network Denial of Service (T1498).
