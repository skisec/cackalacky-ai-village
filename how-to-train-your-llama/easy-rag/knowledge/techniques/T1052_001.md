# Exfiltration over USB (T1052.001)

## Description
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a USB connected physical device. In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a USB device introduced by a user. The USB device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.

## Detection
Monitor file access on removable media. Detect processes that execute when removable media are mounted.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for newly executed processes when removable media is mounted 

Analytic 1 - Detecting Processes Executed from USB Devices 

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (process_name IN ("explorer.exe", "powershell.exe", "cmd.exe", "bash", "sh") AND process_path LIKE "/media/usb/%")
| eval risk_score=case(
    process_path LIKE "/media/usb/%", 9,
    process_path LIKE "D:\\USB\\%", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, process_name, process_path, risk_score```

#### Drive: Drive Creation (DS0016): 
Monitor for newly assigned drive letters or mount points to a data storage device that may attempt to exfiltrate data over a USB connected physical device.

Analytic 1 - Detecting New USB Drive Mounting Events

```(EventCode=6 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/syslog" "usb-storage added" OR source="com.apple.DiskArbitration")
| where (device_type IN ("USB", "Removable Storage"))
| stats count by _time, host, user, device_name, device_type
| eval risk_score=case(
    device_type="USB", 9,
    device_type="Removable Storage", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, user, device_name, device_type, risk_score ```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor file access on removable media that may attempt to exfiltrate data over a USB connected physical device.

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Transfers to USB Storage 

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/media/usb/*", "/mnt/usb/*", "D:\\USB\\*", "E:\\USB\\*"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_path LIKE "%/media/usb/%", 9,
    file_path LIKE "%D:\\USB\\%", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, risk_score```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for execution of file transfer commands targeting USB storage (robocopy, xcopy, cp, rsync), use of disk management utilities (diskpart, mount, mkfs, fdisk), or PowerShell or Bash scripts automating USB file transfers.

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Transfers to USB via Command Execution

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("robocopy", "xcopy", "cp", "rsync", "mount", "diskutil", "diskpart"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("robocopy", "cp", "rsync"), 9,
    command IN ("mount", "diskutil", "diskpart"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```
