# Identify Roles (T1591.004)

## Description
Adversaries may gather information about identities and roles within the victim organization that can be used during targeting. Information about business roles may reveal a variety of targetable details, including identifiable information for key personnel as well as what data/resources they have access to.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information (T1598). Information about business roles may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media (T1593.001) or Search Victim-Owned Websites (T1594)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information (T1598) or Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: Establish Accounts (T1585) or Compromise Accounts (T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: Phishing (T1566)).

## Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
