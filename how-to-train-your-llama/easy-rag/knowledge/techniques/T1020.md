# Automated Exfiltration (T1020)

## Description
Adversaries may exfiltrate data, such as sensitive documents, through the use of automated processing after being gathered during Collection. 

When automated exfiltration is used, other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) and Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048).

## Sub-techniques
- Traffic Duplication (T1020.001)

## Tactics
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

## Detection
Monitor process file access patterns and network behavior. Unrecognized processes or scripts that appear to be traversing file systems and sending network traffic may be suspicious.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor execution of exfiltration-related commands such as scp, rsync, curl, ftp, wget, command-line utilities used to archive and move data (tar, zip, 7z), suspicious execution of scripts performing batch file transfers, or unusual usage of PowerShell, Bash, or Python for bulk file movement.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Automated File Exfiltration Commands

```(EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("scp", "rsync", "curl", "ftp", "wget", "powershell -enc", "tar -cf", "zip -r", "7z a"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("scp", "rsync", "curl"), 9,
    command IN ("tar -cf", "zip -r"), 8,
    command IN ("powershell -enc", "wget"), 7
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze network flows associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, or gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns). Consider analyzing newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts, unexpected hardware devices, or other uncommon data flows.

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for abnormal access to files (i.e. .pdf, .docx, .jpg, etc.), especially sensitive documents, through the use of automated processing after being gathered during Collection.

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Access Before Automated Exfiltration 

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "/media/exfil/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_path IN ("/media/exfil/*"), 9,
    file_path IN ("/var/tmp/*"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections associated with processes performing collection activity, especially those involving abnormal/untrusted hosts. 

Analytic 1 - Detecting Automated Exfiltration via Network 

``` (EventCode=3)
OR (source="zeek_conn.log" dest_port IN (21, 22, 443, 53) AND bytes_out > 5000000)
OR (source="firewall_logs" bytes_out > 10000000)
| eval risk_score=case(
    bytes_out > 10000000, 9,
    bytes_out > 5000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, dest_ip, dest_port, bytes_out, risk_score ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor network traffic content for evidence of data exfiltration, such as gratuitous or anomalous outbound traffic containing collected data. Consider correlation with process monitoring and command lines associated with collection and exfiltration.

#### Script: Script Execution (DS0012): 
Monitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent. 

Analytic 1 - Detecting Automated Script Execution for Exfiltration

```(EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (script_path IN ("*.ps1", "*.sh", "*.py", "*.bat"))
| where (command IN ("scp", "rsync", "ftp", "curl", "wget"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    script_path LIKE "%.ps1", 9,
    script_path LIKE "%.sh", 8,
    script_path LIKE "%.bat", 7
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, script_path, command, risk_score ```
