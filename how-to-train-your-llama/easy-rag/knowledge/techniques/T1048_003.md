# Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003)

## Description
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.

Adversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS). This may include custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) as well as embedding data within protocol headers and fields.

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used.  

For network infrastructure devices, collect AAA logging to monitor for `copy` commands being run to exfiltrate configuration files to non-standard destinations over unencrypted protocols such as TFTP.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor files being accessed and staged before unencrypted exfiltration, creation of compressed archives before network transmission, or presence of encoded file formats that indicate obfuscation (.b64, .zip, .tar).

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Access Before Unencrypted Exfiltration 

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/tmp/*", "/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil") AND file_extension IN ("b64", "tar", "zip"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_extension="b64" OR file_extension="tar", 9,
    file_extension="zip", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, file_extension, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor for data obfuscation methods such as Base64, XOR, or URL encoding in HTTP requests, use of TFTP, FTP, or DNS for data exfiltration, or outbound requests containing encoded strings in GET or POST parameters.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Encoded Data in Unencrypted Alternative Protocols 

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_http.log" OR source="dns.log")
| where (uri_length > 200 OR request_body_length > 5000)
| eval encoded_data=if(match(uri, "([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,})") OR match(request_body, "([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,})"), 1, 0)
| where encoded_data=1
| stats count by _time, host, user, uri, request_body_length, risk_score
| eval risk_score=case(
    request_body_length > 10000, 9,
    request_body_length > 5000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, uri, request_body_length, risk_score```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for execution of exfiltration-related commands such as ftp, curl, scp, tftp, use of Base64 encoding, gzip, or other obfuscation before transmission, or use of CLI-based copy commands to move files to external destinations.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Unencrypted Exfiltration via Command Execution 

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("ftp", "curl -T", "wget --post-file", "scp", "rsync", "tftp", "base64"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("ftp", "scp", "tftp"), 9,
    command IN ("base64", "gzip", "tar"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for unencrypted outbound network connections involving file transfer protocols, processes sending significantly more data than they receive, or outbound data transfers occurring at unusual times.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Alternative Protocols 

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (dest_port IN (21, 53, 69, 139, 445, 8080) AND bytes_out > 10000000)
| stats count, sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, process, dest_ip, dest_port
| where count >= 3 AND total_bytes > 50000000
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 100000000, 9,
    total_bytes > 50000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, dest_port, risk_score```
