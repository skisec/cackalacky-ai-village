# User Execution (T1204)

## Description
An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of Phishing (T1566).

While User Execution (T1204) frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after Internal Spearphishing (T1534).

Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as:

* Enabling Remote Access Tools (T1219), allowing direct control of the system to the adversary
* Running malicious JavaScript in their browser, allowing adversaries to Steal Web Session Cookie (T1539)s
* Downloading and executing malware for User Execution (T1204)
* Coerceing users to copy, paste, and execute malicious code manually

For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through Phishing (T1566), vishing, or various forms of user interaction. Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spoofing and promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing malware or Remote Access Tools (T1219).

## Detection
Monitor the execution of and command-line arguments for applications that may be used by an adversary to gain Initial Access that require user interaction. This includes compression applications, such as those for zip files, that can be used to Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140) in payloads.

Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded and executed on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the file is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning powershell.exe).

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Instance: Instance Start (DS0030): 
Monitor for the activation or invocation of an instance (ex: instance.start within GCP Audit Logs)

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded and executed on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the file is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning powershell.exe).

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor network traffic patterns associated with web-based user actions, such as clicking on phishing links or executing malware that tries to establish C2 communication.

Analytic 1 - Web-based network connections to suspicious destinations.

```sourcetype=sysmon EventCode=3
| search process_name IN ("winword.exe", "chrome.exe", "firefox.exe") 
| stats count by src_ip dest_ip dest_port process_name
| where dest_ip NOT IN ("<known_good_ips>") ```

#### Container: Container Creation (DS0032): 
Monitor for newly constructed containers that may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.

Analytic 1 - Containers communicating with unexpected external services.

```sourcetype=container_creation OR sourcetype=container_start
| stats count by container_name event_description user
| where container_name NOT IN ("<known_containers>") AND event_description IN ("created", "started") ```

#### Instance: Instance Creation (DS0030): 
Monitor for newly constructed instances that may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated with web-based network connections that are sent to malicious or suspicious destinations (e.g. destinations attributed to phishing campaigns). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate network connections or unusual connections initiated by regsvr32.exe, rundll.exe, .SCF, HTA, MSI, DLLs, or msiexec.exe).

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Identify processes spawned by user actions, especially from Office documents, PDFs, or web browsers that could lead to malicious execution.

Analytic 1 - Processes created from user interaction with files.

``` ((sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4688) OR (sourcetype=Sysmon EventCode=1))
| search parent_process IN ("winword.exe", "excel.exe", "chrome.exe", "firefox.exe")
| stats count by parent_process process_name command_line user
| where process_name NOT IN ("chrome.exe", "firefox.exe", "winword.exe", "excel.exe")```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Detect commands triggered by users, especially related to decompression tools (e.g., zip files) that may unpack malicious payloads. This includes compression applications, such as those for zip files, that can be used to Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140) in payloads.

Analytic 1 - Command lines showing decompression or decoding actions.

``` sourcetype=WinEventLog:Powershell EventCode=4104
| search process_name IN ("powershell.exe", "cmd.exe", "zip.exe", "winrar.exe")
| stats count by process_name command_line user
| where command_line LIKE "%unzip%" OR command_line LIKE "%decode%"``` 

#### Image: Image Creation (DS0007): 
Monitor for newly constructed image that may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor logs from applications to detect user-initiated actions such as opening malicious documents, clicking on phishing links, or executing downloaded malware.

Analytic 1 - Logs showing unexpected user actions triggering unusual processes.

``` sourcetype=application_log EventCode=1000 OR EventCode=1001
| search application IN ("winword.exe", "excel.exe", "chrome.exe", "firefox.exe", "adobe.exe", "zip.exe")
| stats count by application event_description
| where event_description IN ("opened document", "clicked link", "executed file")```

#### Container: Container Start (DS0032): 
Monitor for the activation or invocation of a container (ex: docker start or docker restart)
