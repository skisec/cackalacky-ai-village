# Exfiltration to Cloud Storage (T1567.002)

## Description
Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel. Cloud storage services allow for the storage, edit, and retrieval of data from a remote cloud storage server over the Internet.

Examples of cloud storage services include Dropbox and Google Docs. Exfiltration to these cloud storage services can provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if hosts within the network are already communicating with the service.

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server) to known cloud storage services. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. User behavior monitoring may help to detect abnormal patterns of activity.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for unusual outbound connections to cloud storage domains, processes sending significantly more data than they receive, or high-bandwidth file transfers to cloud services.

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (dest_ip IN (known_cloud_services) AND bytes_out > 5000000)
| stats count, sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, process, dest_ip
| where total_bytes > 50000000
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 100000000, 9,
    total_bytes > 50000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Monitor for cloud storages for data exfiltration. 


#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for files being accessed to exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel.

```(EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/tmp/*", "/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_path LIKE "/tmp/%", 9,
    file_path LIKE "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, risk_score ``` 

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for execution of cloud storage CLI tools (rclone, gdrive, aws s3 cp, azcopy, gsutil), use of PowerShell, Bash, or Python scripts to upload files to cloud storage, or attempts to obfuscate file uploads via scripting (e.g., Base64 encoding before upload).

| where (command IN ("rclone copy", "aws s3 cp", "gsutil cp", "azcopy copy", "curl -T", "wget --post-file"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("rclone copy", "aws s3 cp"), 9,
    command IN ("curl -T", "wget --post-file"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score ```
