# Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.002)

## Description
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an asymmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. 

Asymmetric encryption algorithms are those that use different keys on each end of the channel. Also known as public-key cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt data from the corresponding key. Each end of the communication channels requires a private key (only in the procession of that entity) and the public key of the other entity. The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted communications begin. 

Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption (such as HTTPS/TLS/SSL) often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged. Adversaries may opt to use these encrypted mechanisms that are baked into a protocol.

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for execution of asymmetric encryption tools (e.g., OpenSSL, GPG, SSH key exchange), processes generating RSA/ECC key pairs before outbound network activity, or file encryption activity linked to later network transmissions.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Asymmetric Encryption Before Exfiltration

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("openssl rsautl -encrypt", "gpg --encrypt", "ssh-keygen -t rsa", "openssl pkeyutl -encrypt"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("openssl rsautl -encrypt", "gpg --encrypt"), 9,
    command IN ("ssh-keygen -t rsa", "openssl pkeyutl -encrypt"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor files being encrypted before transmission, temporary storage of encrypted files in staging areas before exfiltration, or presence of public/private key files in suspicious locations.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Encrypted Files Before Exfiltration 

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/tmp/*", "/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil") AND file_extension IN ("gpg", "rsa", "pem", "p12"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_extension="gpg" OR file_extension="rsa", 9,
    file_extension="pem" OR file_extension="p12", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, file_extension, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for outbound network connections using TLS-based encryption over non-standard ports, processes initiating large encrypted data transfers that typically do not communicate, or encrypted traffic with long-duration sessions indicative of large data exfiltration.

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (dest_port IN (22, 443, 465, 993, 995) AND bytes_out > 10000000)
| stats count, sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, process, dest_ip, dest_port
| where count >= 3 AND total_bytes > 50000000
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 100000000, 9,
    total_bytes > 50000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, dest_port, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor for asymmetric encryption key exchange over unexpected network channels, detection of long Base64, PEM, or PGP keys transmitted in network payloads, or TLS handshakes or encrypted payloads in non-TLS standard traffic.

| eval encoded_data=if(match(uri, "-----BEGIN (RSA|EC|PGP) PRIVATE KEY-----") OR match(request_body, "-----BEGIN (RSA|EC|PGP) PUBLIC KEY-----"), 1, 0)
| where encoded_data=1
| stats count by _time, host, user, uri, request_body_length, risk_score
| eval risk_score=case(
    request_body_length > 10000, 9,
    request_body_length > 5000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, uri, request_body_length, risk_score ```
