# Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)

## Description
Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.Â A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.

An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through Network Service Discovery (T1046) or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.

There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB and RDP as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL and web server services. Additionally, there have been a number of vulnerabilities in VMware vCenter installations, which may enable threat actors to move laterally from the compromised vCenter server to virtual machines or even to ESXi hypervisors.

Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068) as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.

## Detection
Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash. Also look for behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of the processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of Process Injection (T1055) for attempts to hide execution, evidence of Discovery (TA0007), or other unusual network traffic that may indicate additional tools transferred to the system.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Use deep packet inspection to look for artifacts of common exploit traffic, such as known payloads.

``` sourcetype="network:packet_capture" OR sourcetype="ids:alert"
| search (alert IN ("SMB Exploit Detected", "RDP Exploit Attempt", "MySQL Exploit Attempt")) OR (src_port IN (445, 3389, 3306))
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, protocol, signature, _time
| eval anomaly_detected=if(count > threshold OR match(signature, "Exploit Attempt|Remote Code Execution"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where anomaly_detected="suspicious"
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, protocol, signature, anomaly_detected```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash. Web Application Firewalls may detect improper inputs attempting exploitation.

``` sourcetype="WinEventLog:System" (EventCode=7031 OR EventCode=1000) OR sourcetype="linux:syslog" OR sourcetype="macos:system"
| search Message="service terminated unexpectedly" OR Message="segmentation fault" OR Message="service restart"
| stats count by Host, ServiceName, Message, _time
| eval exploitation_suspicious=if(count > threshold OR match(Message, "segmentation fault|service terminated unexpectedly"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where exploitation_suspicious="suspicious"
| table _time, Host, ServiceName, Message, exploitation_suspicious```
