# Clear Linux or Mac System Logs (T1070.002)

## Description
Adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macOS and Linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs. The majority of native system logging is stored under the ```/var/log/``` directory. Subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions, such as:

* ```/var/log/messages:```: General and system-related messages
* ```/var/log/secure``` or ```/var/log/auth.log```: Authentication logs
* ```/var/log/utmp``` or ```/var/log/wtmp```: Login records
* ```/var/log/kern.log```: Kernel logs
* ```/var/log/cron.log```: Crond logs
* ```/var/log/maillog```: Mail server logs
* ```/var/log/httpd/```: Web server access and error logs

## Detection
File system monitoring may be used to detect improper deletion or modification of indicator files. Also monitor for suspicious processes interacting with log files.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Deletion (DS0022): 
Monitor for unexpected deletion of a system log file, typically stored in /var/logs or /Library/Logs. 

#### File: File Modification (DS0022): 
Monitor for changes made to system log files, typically stored in  /var/log or /Library/Logs, for unexpected modifications to access permissions and attributes 

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments for actions that could be taken to remove or overwrite system logs.
