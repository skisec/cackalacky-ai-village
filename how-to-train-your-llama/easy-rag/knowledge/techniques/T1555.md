# Credentials from Password Stores (T1555)

## Description
Adversaries may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials. Passwords are stored in several places on a system, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials. There are also specific applications and services that store passwords to make them easier for users to manage and maintain, such as password managers and cloud secrets vaults. Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.

## Detection
Monitor system calls, file read events, and processes for suspicious activity that could indicate searching for a password  or other activity related to performing keyword searches (e.g. password, pwd, login, store, secure, credentials, etc.) in process memory for credentials. File read events should be monitored surrounding known password storage applications.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for files being accessed that may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized access to files containing credentials.

```index=security sourcetype IN ("WinEventLog:Security", "WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational", "linux_secure", "macos_secure")
((sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4663 ObjectName IN ("*passwords*", "*creds*", "*credentials*", "*secrets*")) OR
 (sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=11 TargetObject IN ("*passwords*", "*creds*", "*credentials*", "*secrets*")) OR
 (sourcetype="linux_secure" action="open" filepath IN ("*/etc/shadow*", "*/etc/passwd*", "*/.aws/credentials*", "*/.ssh/id_rsa*")) OR
 (sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="open" file_path IN ("*/Library/Keychains/*", "*/Users/*/Library/Keychains/*", "*/Users/*/.ssh/id_rsa*"))) ```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.

Analytic 1 - Commands indicating credential searches.

``` (index=os sourcetype IN ("Powershell", "linux_secure", "macos_secure") 
CommandLine IN ("*findstr* /si password", "*findstr* /si pass", "*grep* -r password", "*grep* -r pass", "*grep* -r secret", "*security* find-generic-password", "*security* find-internet-password", "*security* dump-keychain", "*gsettings* get org.gnome.crypto.cache", "*cat* /etc/shadow", "*strings* /etc/shadow", "*ls -al* ~/.ssh/known_hosts", "*ssh-add* -L")
)```

#### Process: Process Access (DS0009): 
Monitor for processes being accessed that may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized process access indicating credential searches.

``` index=security sourcetype IN ("WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational", "linux_secure", "macos_secure")
(EventCode=10 TargetImage IN ("*lsass.exe", "*securityd*", "*ssh-agent*", "*gpg-agent*") OR
 EventCode=11 TargetObject IN ("*password*", "*creds*", "*credentials*", "*secrets*", "*keychain*", "*.kdbx", "*.pfx", "*.pem", "*.p12", "*.key") OR
 EventCode=1 CommandLine IN ("*mimikatz*", "*procdump*", "*gcore*", "*dbxutil*", "*security find-generic-password*", "*security find-internet-password*", "*security dump-keychain*", "*gsettings get org.gnome.crypto.cache*"))```

#### Cloud Service: Cloud Service Enumeration (DS0025): 
Monitor for API calls and CLI commands that attempt to enumerate and fetch credential material from cloud secrets managers, such as `get-secret-value` in AWS, `gcloud secrets describe` in GCP, and `az key vault secret show` in Azure. Alert on any suspicious usages of these commands, such as an account or service generating an unusually high number of secret requests.

Analytic 1 - High volume of secret requests from unusual accounts or services.

``` index=security sourcetype IN ("aws:cloudtrail", "azure:activity", "gcp:activity")
(eventName IN ("ListAccessKeys", "GetLoginProfile", "ListSecrets", "GetSecretValue", "GetParametersByPath", "ListKeys") OR
operationName IN ("ListAccessKeys", "GetLoginProfile", "ListSecrets", "GetSecretValue", "GetParametersByPath", "ListKeys") OR
protoPayload.methodName IN ("ListAccessKeys", "GetLoginProfile", "ListSecrets", "GetSecretValue", "GetParametersByPath", "ListKeys"))```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor newly executed processes that may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.

Analytic 1 - New processes with parameters indicating credential searches.

``` index=security sourcetype IN ("WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational", "linux_secure", "macos_secure")
(EventCode=1 CommandLine IN ("*mimikatz*", "*procdump*", "*gcore*", "*dbxutil*", "*security find-generic-password*", "*security find-internet-password*", "*security dump-keychain*", "*gsettings get org.gnome.crypto.cache*", "*cat /etc/shadow*", "*strings /etc/shadow*", "*ls -al ~/.ssh/known_hosts*", "*ssh-add -L*"))```

#### Process: OS API Execution (DS0009): 
Monitor for API calls that may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.
