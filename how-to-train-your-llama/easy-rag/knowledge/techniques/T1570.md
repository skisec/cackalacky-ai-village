# Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570)

## Description
Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. Once brought into the victim environment (i.e., Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)) files may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.

Adversaries may copy files between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002) to connected network shares or with authenticated connections via Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001).

Files can also be transferred using native or otherwise present tools on the victim system, such as scp, rsync, curl, sftp, and ftp. In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage Web Service (T1102)s such as Dropbox or OneDrive to copy files from one machine to another via shared, automatically synced folders.

## Detection
Monitor for file creation and files transferred within a network using protocols such as SMB or FTP. Unusual processes with internal network connections creating files on-system may be suspicious. Consider monitoring for abnormal usage of utilities and command-line arguments that may be used in support of remote transfer of files. Considering monitoring for alike file hashes or characteristics (ex: filename) that are created on multiple hosts.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Named Pipe: Named Pipe Metadata (DS0023): 
Monitor for contextual data about named pipes on the system.

#### Network Share: Network Share Access (DS0033): 
Monitor for unexpected network share access, such as files transferred between shares within a network using protocols such as SMB.

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware. 

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments for actions for abnormal usage of utilities and command-line arguments that may be used in support of remote transfer of files

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor newly constructed processes that assist in lateral tool transfers. 

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor newly constructed files to/from a lateral tool transfer 

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor for unusual processes with internal network connections creating files on-system may be suspicious 

Note: Analytic Event Type is for Zeek but can also be implemented in other Network Analysis Frameworks by parsing & decoding captured SMB2 network traffic. From a network traffic capture standpoint, itâ€™s important to capture the right traffic for this type of detection to function (e.g., all endpoint to endpoint if possible or workstation to server and workstation to workstation). As such, it is helpful to have a centralized server area where it is possible to monitor communications between servers and endpoints.


#### File: File Metadata (DS0022): 
Monitor for alike file hashes or characteristics (ex: filename) that are created on multiple hosts.
