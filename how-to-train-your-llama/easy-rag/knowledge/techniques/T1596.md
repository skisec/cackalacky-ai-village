# Search Open Technical Databases (T1596)

## Description
Adversaries may search freely available technical databases for information about victims that can be used during targeting. Information about victims may be available in online databases and repositories, such as registrations of domains/certificates as well as public collections of network data/artifacts gathered from traffic and/or scans.

Adversaries may search in different open databases depending on what information they seek to gather. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information (T1598) or Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: Acquire Infrastructure (T1583) or Compromise Infrastructure (T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services (T1133) or Trusted Relationship (T1199)).

## Sub-techniques
- Digital Certificates (T1596.003)
- WHOIS (T1596.002)
- DNS/Passive DNS (T1596.001)
- CDNs (T1596.004)
- Scan Databases (T1596.005)

## Tactics
- Reconnaissance (TA0043)

## Related Groups
- APT28 (G0007)
- Kimsuky (G0094)

## Mitigations
- Pre-compromise (M1056)

## Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
