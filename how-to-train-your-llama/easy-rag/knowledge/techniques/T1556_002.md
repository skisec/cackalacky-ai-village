# Password Filter DLL (T1556.002)

## Description
Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated. 

Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts. Filters are implemented as DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies. Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts. Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), the Local Security Authority (LSA) requests validation from each registered filter. Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation. 

Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.

## Detection
Monitor for new, unfamiliar DLL files written to a domain controller and/or local computer. Monitor for changes to Registry entries for password filters (ex: ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages```) and correlate then investigate the DLL files these files reference.

Password filters will also show up as an autorun and loaded DLL in lsass.exe.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Modification (DS0024): 
Monitor for changes to Registry entries for password filters (ex: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages) and correlate then investigate the DLL files these files reference.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized modifications to Registry entries for password filters.

``` index=windows_logs sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" (EventCode=4657 OR EventCode=4688)
| search (
    (TargetObject="*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\" AND ValueName="Notification Packages")
    OR (TargetObject="*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\" AND ValueName="Authentication Packages")
    OR (CommandLine="*reg.exe*" AND CommandLine="*add*" AND CommandLine="*Lsa*")
  )
| eval Modification_Type=case(
    like(CommandLine, "%reg.exe% add%"), "Command Line Registry Edit",
    EventCode=4657, "Direct Registry Modification"
  )```

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for newly constructed files that may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized DLL registration.

``` index=windows_logs sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
| search (EventCode=4688 AND (CommandLine="*regsvr32*" OR CommandLine="*rundll32*") AND CommandLine="*password.dll*")
| join type=left Host [
    search index=windows_logs sourcetype="WinEventLog:System"
    | eval File_Creation_Time=strftime(_time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    | where EventCode=7045 OR EventCode=2
    | fields Host, File_Creation_Time, FileName, FilePath
  ]
| eval suspected_dll=if(match(FilePath, ".*\\System32\\.*") OR match(FilePath, ".*\\SysWOW64\\.*"), "High", "Low")```

#### Module: Module Load (DS0011): 
Monitor for new, unfamiliar DLL files written to a domain controller and/or local computer. Password filters will also show up as an autorun and loaded DLL in lsass.exe.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized DLL loads in critical systems.

```index=windows_logs sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
| search EventCode=7 [search index=windows_logs EventCode=4688 (ProcessName="*lsass.exe" OR ProcessName="*winlogon.exe") | fields ProcessID]
| eval dll_path=coalesce(ImageLoaded, Image)
| search dll_path="*\\System32\\*" OR dll_path="*\\SysWOW64\\*"
| rex field=dll_path ".*\\(?<dll_name>[^\\]+\.dll)$" ```
