# Hardware (T1592.001)

## Description
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host hardware that can be used during targeting. Information about hardware infrastructure may include a variety of details such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: card/biometric readers, dedicated encryption hardware, etc.).

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning (T1595) (ex: hostnames, server banners, user agent strings) or Phishing for Information (T1598). Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors. Information about the hardware infrastructure may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593) or Search Open Technical Databases (T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities (T1587) or Obtain Capabilities (T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain (T1195.003) or Hardware Additions (T1200)).

## Tactics
- Reconnaissance (TA0043)

## Mitigations
- Pre-compromise (M1056)

## Detection
Internet scanners may be used to look for patterns associated with malicious content designed to collect host hardware information from visitors.

Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
