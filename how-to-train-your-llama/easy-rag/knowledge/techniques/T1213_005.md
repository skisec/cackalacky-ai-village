# Messaging Applications (T1213.005)

## Description
Adversaries may leverage chat and messaging applications, such as Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, and Slack, to mine valuable information.  

The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on messaging applications: 

* Testing / development credentials (i.e., Chat Messages (T1552.008)) 
* Source code snippets 
* Links to network shares and other internal resources 
* Proprietary data
* Discussions about ongoing incident response efforts

In addition to exfiltrating data from messaging applications, adversaries may leverage data from chat messages in order to improve their targeting - for example, by learning more about an environment or evading ongoing incident response efforts.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information. Monitor access to messaging applications, especially performed by privileged users such as Active Directory Domain or Enterprise Administrators as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access messaging applications. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.
