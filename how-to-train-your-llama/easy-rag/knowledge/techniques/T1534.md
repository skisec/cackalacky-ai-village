# Internal Spearphishing (T1534)

## Description
After they already have access to accounts or systems within the environment, adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information or compromise other users within the same organization. Internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where a legitimate account is initially compromised either by controlling the user's device or by compromising the account credentials of the user. Adversaries may then attempt to take advantage of the trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking more victims into falling for phish attempts, often incorporating Impersonation (T1656).

For example, adversaries may leverage Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001) or Spearphishing Link (T1566.002) as part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials through Input Capture (T1056) on sites that mimic login interfaces.

Adversaries may also leverage internal chat apps, such as Microsoft Teams, to spread malicious content or engage users in attempts to capture sensitive information and/or credentials.

## Detection
Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways usually do not scan internal email, but an organization can leverage the journaling-based solution which sends a copy of emails to a security service for offline analysis or incorporate service-integrated solutions using on-premise or API-based integrations to help detect internal spearphishing campaigns.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor for communication traffic containing suspicious payloads or URLs, especially those associated with internal email or chat systems. Analyze for outbound or inbound traffic related to known or newly registered domains that could be used for credential phishing or payload delivery.

``` sourcetype="network:packet_capture" OR sourcetype="ids:alert"
| search (http_request_uri="*.php?login" OR dns IN ("suspiciousdomain.com", "newly-registered-domain.com")) OR (http_method="POST" AND url_length > threshold)
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, protocol, http_request_uri, _time
| eval anomaly_detected=if(count > threshold OR match(http_request_uri, "login|credentials|reset"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where anomaly_detected="suspicious"
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, http_request_uri, protocol, anomaly_detected```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor email gateways usually do not scan internal email, but an organization can leverage the journaling-based solution which sends a copy of emails to a security service for offline analysis or incorporate service-integrated solutions using on-premise or API-based integrations to help detect internal spearphishing attacks.

``` sourcetype="office365:audit" OR sourcetype="googleworkspace:email" OR sourcetype="chat:log"
| search action IN ("SendEmail", "AddAttachment", "CreateMailItem") OR event IN ("message_sent", "attachment_added")
| eval sender_domain=split(sender, "@")[1]
| where sender_domain="internaldomain.com" AND (like(subject, "%urgent%") OR like(body, "%reset your password%") OR match(attachment, "\.(exe|vbs|js|docm|xlsm|zip)"))
| stats count by sender, recipient, subject, attachment, _time
| eval spearphishing_detected=if(count > threshold OR match(subject, "reset|verify|urgent|important"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where spearphishing_detected="suspicious"
| table _time, sender, recipient, subject, attachment, spearphishing_detected```
