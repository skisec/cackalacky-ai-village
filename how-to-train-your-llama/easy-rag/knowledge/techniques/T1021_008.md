# Direct Cloud VM Connections (T1021.008)

## Description
Adversaries may leverage Valid Accounts (T1078) to log directly into accessible cloud hosted compute infrastructure through cloud native methods. Many cloud providers offer interactive connections to virtual infrastructure that can be accessed through the Cloud API (T1059.009), such as Azure Serial Console, AWS EC2 Instance Connect, and AWS System Manager..

Methods of authentication for these connections can include passwords, application access tokens, or SSH keys. These cloud native methods may, by default, allow for privileged access on the host with SYSTEM or root level access. 

Adversaries may utilize these cloud native methods to directly access virtual infrastructure and pivot through an environment. These connections typically provide direct console access to the VM rather than the execution of scripts (i.e., Cloud Administration Command (T1651)).

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor cloud audit logs and host logs for logon session events. These can be found in CloudTrail, Unified Audit Logs, Windows Event Logs and `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure` for Linux systems. Monitor direct cloud VM logins through native services, such as Azure Serial Console or AWS EC2 Instance Connect, especially focusing on privileged access or access attempts that deviate from established baselines. Identify unexpected or unauthorized access patterns, such as logins from untrusted IP addresses, irregular times, or unauthorized users accessing sensitive VMs.
