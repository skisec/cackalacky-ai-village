# Remote Desktop Software (T1219.002)

## Description
An adversary may use legitimate desktop support software to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks. Desktop support software provides a graphical interface for remotely controlling another computer, transmitting the display output, keyboard input, and mouse control between devices using various protocols. Desktop support software, such as `VNC`, `Team Viewer`, `AnyDesk`, `ScreenConnect`, `LogMein`, `AmmyyAdmin`, and other remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, are commonly used as legitimate technical support software and may be allowed by application control within a target environment. 
 
Remote access modules/features may also exist as part of otherwise existing software such as Zoom or Google Chrome’s Remote Desktop.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g. extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for applications and processes related to remote desktop software. Correlate activity with other suspicious behavior that may reduce false positives if this type of software is used by legitimate users and administrators. Domain Fronting (T1090.004) may be used in conjunction to avoid defenses. Adversaries will likely need to deploy and/or install these remote software to compromised systems. It may be possible to detect or prevent the installation of this type of software with host-based solutions.

Analytic 1 - Detect Remote Desktop Execution

``` sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
(Image="*\\TeamViewer.exe" OR Image="*\\AnyDesk.exe" OR Image="*\\Ammyy_Admin.exe" OR Image="*\\connectwisecontrol.client.exe")
| stats count by Image, ParentImage, CommandLine, user, host, _time
| sort -_time
```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for Outbound connections to known RMM service endpoints (e.g., *.teamviewer.com, *.anydesk.com)
New connections from internal systems to unexpected IPs on:
TCP 5938 (TeamViewer)
TCP 7070–7071 (AnyDesk)
TCP 5650 (Ammyy Admin)
TCP/UDP 443, 80, or randomized ports

Analytic 1 - Detect network traffic for Remote Desktop software 

``` sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=3
(DestinationHostname IN ("*.teamviewer.com", "*.anydesk.com", "*.logmein.com", "*.screenconnect.com"))
OR (DestinationPort IN (5938, 7070, 7071, 443) AND Image="*")
| stats count by Image, DestinationIp, DestinationPort, CommandLine, host, _time
| sort -_time
