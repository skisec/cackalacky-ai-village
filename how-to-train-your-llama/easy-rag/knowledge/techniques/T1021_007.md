# Cloud Services (T1021.007)

## Description
Adversaries may log into accessible cloud services within a compromised environment using Valid Accounts (T1078) that are synchronized with or federated to on-premises user identities. The adversary may then perform management actions or access cloud-hosted resources as the logged-on user. 

Many enterprises federate centrally managed user identities to cloud services, allowing users to login with their domain credentials in order to access the cloud control plane. Similarly, adversaries may connect to available cloud services through the web console or through the cloud command line interface (CLI) (e.g., Cloud API (T1059.009)), using commands such as ```Connect-AZAccount``` for Azure PowerShell, ```Connect-MgGraph``` for Microsoft Graph PowerShell, and ```gcloud auth login``` for the Google Cloud CLI.

In some cases, adversaries may be able to authenticate to these services via Application Access Token (T1550.001) instead of a username and password.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior to cloud services. For example, in Azure AD, consider using Identity Protection to monitor for suspicious login behaviors to cloud resources. 

```sourcetype="azure:signinlogs" OR sourcetype="google:admin_audit" OR sourcetype="o365:audit"
| stats count by UserPrincipalName, ClientIP, _time, LoginStatus
| eval suspicious=if(LoginStatus="failure" OR match(ClientIP, "untrusted_ip_pattern"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where suspicious="suspicious"
| table _time, UserPrincipalName, ClientIP, LoginStatus, suspicious ```
