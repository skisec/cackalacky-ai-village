# SVG Smuggling (T1027.017)

## Description
Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign SVG files. SVGs, or Scalable Vector Graphics, are vector-based image files constructed using XML. As such, they can legitimately include `<script>` tags that enable adversaries to include malicious JavaScript payloads. However, SVGs may appear less suspicious to users than other types of executable files, as they are often treated as image files. 

SVG smuggling can take a number of forms. For example, threat actors may include content that: 

* Assembles malicious payloads
* Downloads malicious payloads
* Redirects users to malicious websites
* Displays interactive content to users, such as fake login forms and download buttons.

SVG Smuggling may be used in conjunction with HTML Smuggling (T1027.006) where an SVG with a malicious payload is included inside an HTML file. SVGs may also be included in other types of documents, such as PDFs.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for newly constructed files via JavaScript. Developing rules for the different variants, with a combination of different encoding and/or encryption schemes, may be very challenging. Consider monitoring files downloaded from the Internet, possibly by SVG Smuggling, for suspicious activities. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities. 

SVG Smuggling is often chained:

- .svg downloaded â†’ parsed or executed by browser/email client
- Drops or references a secondary payload (HTML/JS/Payload)
- Follow-on execution with powershell, cmd, wscript, etc.

Analytic 1 - Detect malicious use of SVG files embedded with script tags to assemble, download, or redirect to payloads.

``` index=* (sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" OR sourcetype="linux_audit" OR sourcetype="osquery")
(file_name="*.svg" OR file_path="*\\Downloads\\*.svg" OR file_path="/tmp/*.svg" OR file_path="/Users/*/Downloads/*.svg")
| join type=inner file_path [
  search index=* process_name IN ("powershell.exe", "wscript.exe", "cmd.exe", "mshta.exe", "bash", "curl", "wget")
  | stats min(_time) as proc_time by file_path, process_name, host
]
| eval time_diff=proc_time - _time
| where time_diff >= 0 AND time_diff < 120
| table _time, host, user, file_path, file_name, process_name, command_line, time_diff
| sort _time ```

Analytic 2 - Suspicious JavaScript or Obfuscation in SVG

``` file_name="*.svg"
| rex field=_raw "<script>(?<js_payload>.*?)</script>"
| search js_payload="*eval*" OR js_payload="*atob*" OR js_payload="*window.location*" OR js_payload="*document.write*"
| table _time, file_name, js_payload ```
