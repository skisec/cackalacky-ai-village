# Bash History (T1552.003)

## Description
Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s ```.bash_history``` file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: ```~/.bash_history```. Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.

## Tactics
- Credential Access (TA0006)

## Mitigations
- Operating System Configuration (M1028)

## Detection
Monitoring when the user's ```.bash_history``` is read can help alert to suspicious activity. While users do typically rely on their history of commands, they often access this history through other utilities like "history" instead of commands like ```cat ~/.bash_history```.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitoring when the user's ```.bash_history``` is read can help alert to suspicious activity.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized access to .bash_history.

``` (index=os sourcetype="linux_secure" action="open" filepath="/home/*/.bash_history") OR
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="open" file_path="/Users/*/.bash_history") | where User NOT IN ("root", "daemon", "bin", "nobody", "_spotlight", "_mbsetupuser")
| where NOT match(User, "^[a-z]+$")  # Filter out common service accounts```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
While users do typically rely on their history of commands, they often access this history through other utilities like "history" instead of commands like ```cat ~/.bash_history```.

Analytic 1 - Commands accessing .bash_historythrough unexpected means.

``` (index=os sourcetype="linux_secure" action="open" filepath="/home/*/.bash_history") OR
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="open" file_path="/Users/*/.bash_history")```
