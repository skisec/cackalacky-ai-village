# Distributed Component Object Model (T1021.003)

## Description
Adversaries may use Valid Accounts (T1078) to interact with remote machines by taking advantage of Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

The Windows Component Object Model (COM) is a component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces. Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE). Distributed COM (DCOM) is transparent middleware that extends the functionality of COM beyond a local computer using remote procedure call (RPC) technology.

Permissions to interact with local and remote server COM objects are specified by access control lists (ACL) in the Registry. By default, only Administrators may remotely activate and launch COM objects through DCOM.

Through DCOM, adversaries operating in the context of an appropriately privileged user can remotely obtain arbitrary and even direct shellcode execution through Office applications as well as other Windows objects that contain insecure methods. DCOM can also execute macros in existing documents and may also invoke Dynamic Data Exchange (T1559.002) (DDE) execution directly through a COM created instance of a Microsoft Office application, bypassing the need for a malicious document. DCOM can be used as a method of remotely interacting with Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047). 

## Parent Technique
- Remote Services (T1021)

## Tactics
- Lateral Movement (TA0008)

## Mitigations
- Disable or Remove Feature or Program (M1042)
- Application Isolation and Sandboxing (M1048)
- Network Segmentation (M1030)
- Privileged Account Management (M1026)

## Detection
Monitor for COM objects loading DLLs and other modules not typically associated with the application. Enumeration of COM objects, via Query Registry (T1012) or PowerShell (T1059.001), may also proceed malicious use. Monitor for spawning of processes associated with COM objects, especially those invoked by a user different than the one currently logged on.

Monitor for any influxes or abnormal increases in DCOM related Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Call (DCE/RPC) traffic (typically over port 135).

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections that may use Valid Accounts (T1078) to interact with remote machines using Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). Monitor for any influxes or abnormal increases in DCOM related Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Call (DCE/RPC) traffic (typically over port 135).

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) traffic, especially over port 135, used for DCOM communication. Look for patterns indicating high volumes of RPC calls or connections between systems.

Note: Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on RPC network flows. Traffic to the RPC Endpoint Mapper will always have the destination port of 135. Assuming success, RPC traffic will continue to the endpoint. The endpoint and the client both bind to dynamically assigned ports (on Windows, this is typically greater than 49152). The traffic between the client and endpoint can be detected by looking at traffic to 135 followed by traffic where the source and destination ports are at least 49152.

```sourcetype="seek"
| search dest_port=135 protocol="DCE/RPC"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, _time
| eval rpc_activity=if(count > threshold AND src_ip NOT IN ("trusted_ips"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where rpc_activity="suspicious"
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, rpc_activity ```

#### Module: Module Load (DS0011): 
Monitor for COM objects loading DLLs and other modules not typically associated with the application.

Note: Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image loaded) can be used to monitor for suspicious DLLs loaded by the DCOM Server Process Launcher which runs inside of svchost.exe. This is a particularly noisy event and can generate a large volume of data, so we recommend baselining and filtering out any known benign svchost.exe module loads that occur as part of its typical operation.

```sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=7
| search ImageLoaded="*\\*.dll" ParentImage="*dcomlaunch.exe*"
| stats count by ImageLoaded, ParentImage, User, Computer, _time
| eval suspicious_load=if(count > threshold, "suspicious", "normal")
| where suspicious_load="suspicious"
| table _time, ImageLoaded, ParentImage, User, Computer, suspicious_load ```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for newly executed processes associated with DCOM activity, especially those invoked by a user different than the one currently logged on. Enumeration of COM objects, via Query Registry (T1012) or PowerShell (T1059.001), may also precede malicious use.

The Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe) can be by used by threat actors used to spawn arbitrary processes through DCOM. The typical process tree for this method looks like: svchost.exe —> mmc.exe —> <some_process>.exe. 

Accordingly, look for process creation events of mmc.exe in conjunction with the -Embedding command-line argument, along with suspicious child processes that can be used for malicious purposes, such as cmd.exe, reg.exe, etc.

Similar to the Microsoft Management Console, Excel can also be used to execute processes through DCOM. In this case, the typical process tree looks like: svchost.exe —> excel.exe —> <some_process>.exe. 

Look for process creation events of excel.exe in conjunction with the /automation -Embedding command-line argument, along with suspicious child processes that can be used for malicious purposes, such as cmd.exe, reg.exe, etc.

```sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1
| search ParentImage="*dcomlaunch.exe*" OR CommandLine="*dcom*"
| stats count by ParentImage, CommandLine, User, Computer, _time
| eval suspicious_process=if(count > threshold, "suspicious", "normal")
| where suspicious_process="suspicious"
| table _time, ParentImage, CommandLine, User, Computer, suspicious_process ```
