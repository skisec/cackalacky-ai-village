# Malicious Link (T1204.001)

## Description
An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from Spearphishing Link (T1566.002). Clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203). Links may also lead users to download files that require execution via Malicious File (T1204.002).

- Restrict Web-Based Content (M1021)

## Detection
Inspect network traffic for indications that a user visited a malicious site, such as links included in phishing campaigns directed at your organization.

Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded from a link and executed on the user's computer.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for files created on a system after a user clicks on a malicious link. Look for common download paths and suspicious files with executable extensions.

Analytic 1 - Files downloaded from links and then executed.

``` sourcetype=Sysmon EventCode=11
| search file_path IN ("*/Downloads/*", "*/Temp/*")
| stats count by file_name file_path user
| where file_name LIKE "%.exe" OR file_name LIKE "%.zip" OR file_name LIKE "%.js" OR file_name LIKE "%.docm"```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Inspect the content of the network traffic to look for signs of suspicious web traffic, such as phishing links or abnormal HTTP GET/POST requests.

Analytic 1 - Suspicious network traffic content

``` sourcetype=network_traffic_content
| search http_method="GET" OR http_method="POST"
| stats count by url domain http_method
| where domain NOT IN ("<known_legit_domains>")```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for network connections to suspicious or external sites shortly after a user clicks on a link, especially if the URL is linked to phishing or malicious activities.

Analytic 1 - Web-based network connections to suspicious destinations.

```sourcetype=network_connection
| search process_name IN ("chrome.exe", "firefox.exe", "iexplore.exe", "msedge.exe") OR src_ip IN ("<suspicious_ips>")```
