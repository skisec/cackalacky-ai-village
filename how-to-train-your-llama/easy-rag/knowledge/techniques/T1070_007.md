# Clear Network Connection History and Configurations (T1070.007)

## Description
Adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections in order to clean up traces of their operations. Configuration settings as well as various artifacts that highlight connection history may be created on a system and/or in application logs from behaviors that require network connections, such as Remote Services (T1021) or External Remote Services (T1133). Defenders may use these artifacts to monitor or otherwise analyze network connections created by adversaries.

Network connection history may be stored in various locations. For example, RDP connection history may be stored in Windows Registry values under :

* ```HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default```
* ```HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Servers```

Windows may also store information about recent RDP connections in files such as ```C:\Users\\%username%\Documents\Default.rdp``` and `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal
Server Client\Cache\`. Similarly, macOS and Linux hosts may store information highlighting connection history in system logs (such as those stored in `/Library/Logs` and/or `/var/log/`).

Malicious network connections may also require changes to third-party applications or network configuration settings, such as Disable or Modify System Firewall (T1562.004) or tampering to enable Proxy (T1090). Adversaries may delete or modify this data to conceal indicators and/or impede defensive analysis.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor created processes with arguments that may delete or alter malicious network configuration settings as well as generated artifacts that highlight network connection history on a host system -- which may include logs, files, or Registry values.

#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Modification (DS0024): 
Monitor for changes to Registry keys (ex: ```HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default```) and associated values that may be malicious attempts to conceal adversary network connection history.

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may delete or alter malicious network configuration settings as well as generated artifacts on a host system, including logs and files such as ```Default.rdp``` or ```/var/log/```. 

#### Firewall: Firewall Rule Modification (DS0018): 
Monitor for changes made to firewall rules, especially unexpected modifications that may potentially be related to allowing and/or cleaning up previous tampering that enabled malicious network traffic.

#### File: File Modification (DS0022): 
Monitor changes to files that may be indicators of deleting or altering malicious network configuration settings as well as generated artifacts on a host system that highlight network connection history, such as ```Default.rdp``` or ```/var/log/```.
