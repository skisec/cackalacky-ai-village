# Disable or Modify System Firewall (T1562.004)

## Description
Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.

Modifying or disabling a system firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed. For example, adversaries may add a new firewall rule for a well-known protocol (such as RDP) using a non-traditional and potentially less securitized port (i.e. Non-Standard Port (T1571)).

Adversaries may also modify host networking settings that indirectly manipulate system firewalls, such as interface bandwidth or network connection request thresholds. Settings related to enabling abuse of various Remote Services (T1021) may also indirectly modify firewall rules.

In ESXi, firewall rules may be modified directly via the esxcli command line interface (e.g., via `esxcli network firewall set`) or via the vCenter user interface.

## Detection
Monitor processes and command-line arguments to see if firewalls are disabled or modified. Monitor Registry edits to keys that manage firewalls.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Firewall: Firewall Rule Modification (DS0018): 
Monitor for changes made to firewall rules that might allow remote communication over protocols such as SMD and RDP. Modification of firewall rules might also consider opening local ports and services for different network profiles such as public and domain.

#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Modification (DS0024): 
Monitor for changes made to windows Registry keys and/or values that adversaries might use to disable or modify System Firewall settings such as `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy`.

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments associated with disabling or the modification of system firewalls such as ```netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="file and printer sharing" new enable=Yes```,```ufw disable```, and ```ufw logging off```. On ESXi hosts, monitor for commands such as `esxcli network firewall set â€“enabled=false` or `esxcli network firewall ruleset set --ruleset-id=<rulename> --enabled=true`.


#### Firewall: Firewall Disable (DS0018): 
Monitor for changes in the status of the system firewall such as Windows Security Auditing events 5025 (The Windows firewall service has been stopped) and 5034 (The Windows firewall driver was stopped).
