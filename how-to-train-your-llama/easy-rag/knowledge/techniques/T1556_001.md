# Domain Controller Authentication (T1556.001)

## Description
Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts. 

Malware may be used to inject false credentials into the authentication process on a domain controller with the intent of creating a backdoor used to access any userâ€™s account and/or credentials (ex: Skeleton Key). Skeleton key works through a patch on an enterprise domain controller authentication process (LSASS) with credentials that adversaries may use to bypass the standard authentication system. Once patched, an adversary can use the injected password to successfully authenticate as any domain user account (until the the skeleton key is erased from memory by a reboot of the domain controller). Authenticated access may enable unfettered access to hosts and/or resources within single-factor authentication environments.

## Detection
Monitor for calls to ```OpenProcess``` that can be used to manipulate lsass.exe running on a domain controller as well as for malicious modifications to functions exported from authentication-related system DLLs (such as cryptdll.dll and samsrv.dll).

Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services. Look for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g. a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services.

Analytic 1 - Unusual logon patterns and times.

```index=windows sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" 
(
    (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4768) AND
    Logon_Type=3 AND
    NOT [search index=windows sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4768 | stats count by Account_Name | where count < 10 | fields Account_Name]
) ```

#### Process: Process Access (DS0009): 
Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized process interactions with domain controller authentication processes.

``` index=windows_logs (sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational")
| search (EventCode=4688 AND New_Process_Name="*\\lsass.exe") OR (EventCode=10 AND TargetImage="*\\lsass.exe")
| eval suspicious_process=case(
    match(New_Process_Name, "regex_for_unusual_process_paths"), "High",
    match(New_Process_Name, ".*\\system32\\.*"), "Medium",
    true(), "Low"
  )
| stats count by Host, User, New_Process_Name, CommandLine, suspicious_process

| table _time, Host, User, New_Process_Name, CommandLine, suspicious_process, login_behavior, login_time
| sort - _time```

#### File: File Modification (DS0022): 
Monitor for changes to functions exported from authentication-related system DLLs (such as cryptdll.dll and samsrv.dll).

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized changes to authentication-related DLLs.

```index=windows sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security 
(
    (EventCode=4663 AND Object_Type="File" AND Object_Name IN ("C:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\samlib.dll", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cryptdll.dll", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\samsrv.dll"))
    OR (EventCode=4662 AND Object_Type="File" AND Object_Name IN ("C:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\samlib.dll", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cryptdll.dll", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\samsrv.dll"))
    OR (EventCode=4670 AND Object_Name IN ("C:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\samlib.dll", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cryptdll.dll", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\samsrv.dll"))
