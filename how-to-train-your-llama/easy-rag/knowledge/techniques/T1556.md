# Modify Authentication Process (T1556)

## Description
Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using Valid Accounts (T1078).

Adversaries may maliciously modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication mechanisms. Compromised credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.

## Sub-techniques
- Pluggable Authentication Modules (T1556.003)
- Password Filter DLL (T1556.002)
- Hybrid Identity (T1556.007)
- Network Provider DLL (T1556.008)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (T1556.006)
- Conditional Access Policies (T1556.009)
- Domain Controller Authentication (T1556.001)
- Reversible Encryption (T1556.005)
- Network Device Authentication (T1556.004)

## Tactics
- Credential Access (TA0006)
- Defense Evasion (TA0005)
- Persistence (TA0003)

## Related Groups

## Mitigations
- Restrict Registry Permissions (M1024)
- Multi-factor Authentication (M1032)
- Password Policies (M1027)
- Restrict File and Directory Permissions (M1022)
- User Account Management (M1018)
- Privileged Account Management (M1026)
- Privileged Process Integrity (M1025)
- Audit (M1047)
- Operating System Configuration (M1028)

## Detection
Monitor for new, unfamiliar DLL files written to a domain controller and/or local computer. Monitor for changes to Registry entries for password filters (ex: ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages```) and correlate then investigate the DLL files these files reference. 

Password filters will also show up as an autorun and loaded DLL in lsass.exe.

Monitor for calls to ```OpenProcess``` that can be used to manipulate lsass.exe running on a domain controller as well as for malicious modifications to functions exported from authentication-related system DLLs (such as cryptdll.dll and samsrv.dll). 

Monitor PAM configuration and module paths (ex: ```/etc/pam.d/```) for changes. Use system-integrity tools such as AIDE and monitoring tools such as auditd to monitor PAM files.

Monitor for suspicious additions to the /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins directory.

Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services.  Look for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).

Monitor property changes in Group Policy that manage authentication mechanisms (i.e. Group Policy Modification (T1484.001)). The ```Store passwords using reversible encryption``` configuration should be set to Disabled. Additionally, monitor and/or block suspicious command/script execution of ```-AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true```, ```Set-ADUser``` and ```Set-ADAccountControl```. Finally, monitor Fine-Grained Password Policies and regularly audit user accounts and group settings.


### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Enable security auditing to collect logs from hybrid identity solutions. For example, monitor sign-ins to the Entra ID Application Proxy Connector, which are typically generated only when a new Pass Through Authentication (PTA) Agent is added.  If AD FS is in use, review the logs for event ID 501, which specifies all EKU attributes on a claim, and raise alerts on any values that are not configured in your environment.

Analytic 1 - Unexpected sign-ins or new PTA Agent additions.

``` index=third_party_logs sourcetype IN ("azure:activity", "gsuite:reports:activity", "aws:cloudtrail", "office365:management", "saas_audit")
(eventName IN ("AddServicePrincipal", "AddUser", "UpdateUser", "AddGroup", "UpdateGroup", "AddPolicy", "UpdatePolicy", "AddRole", "UpdateRole", "PutRolePolicy", "AttachUserPolicy", "AttachGroupPolicy", "AttachRolePolicy") OR
 eventCategory IN ("Sign-ins", "Security", "AuditLogs") OR
 EventID IN (501, 4662) OR
 "protoPayload.methodName" IN ("directory.users.update", "admin.directory.group.update", "admin.directory.roleAssignments.update"))```

#### Process: Process Access (DS0009): 
Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized process interactions with authentication mechanisms.

(index=your_index sourcetype=linux_auditd

| stats count by file, user, host )```

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services. 

Analytic 1 - Unusual logon patterns and times.
