# Unsecured Credentials (T1552)

## Description
Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. Bash History (T1552.003)), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. Credentials in Registry (T1552.002)),  or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. Private Keys (T1552.004)).

## Detection
While detecting adversaries accessing credentials may be difficult without knowing they exist in the environment, it may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained. Monitor the command-line arguments of executing processes for suspicious words or regular expressions that may indicate searching for a password (for example: password, pwd, login, secure, or credentials). See Valid Accounts (T1078) for more information.

Monitor for suspicious file access activity, specifically indications that a process is reading multiple files in a short amount of time and/or using command-line arguments  indicative of searching for credential material (ex: regex patterns). These may be indicators of automated/scripted credential access behavior.

Monitoring when the user's ```.bash_history``` is read can help alert to suspicious activity. While users do typically rely on their history of commands, they often access this history through other utilities like "history" instead of commands like ```cat ~/.bash_history```.

Additionally, monitor processes for applications that can be used to query the Registry, such as Reg, and collect command parameters that may indicate credentials are being searched. Correlate activity with related suspicious behavior that may indicate an active intrusion to reduce false positives.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Access (DS0024): 
Monitor for unexpected windows registry key being accessed that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized access to registry keys associated with credentials.

``` index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing" EventCode=4663 ObjectType="Registry" (ObjectName="*password*" OR ObjectName="*credential*") | eval AccessAttempt=case(
    AccessMask="0x1", "Read",
    AccessMask="0x2", "Write",
    AccessMask="0x3", "Read/Write",
    AccessMask="0x4", "Delete",
    true(), "Unknown"
)```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor application logs for activity that may highlight malicious attempts to access application data, especially abnormal search activity targeting passwords and other artifacts related to credentials.

Analytic 1 - Abnormal search activity targeting passwords and other credential artifacts.

``` (index=third_party sourcetype IN ("mailserver_logs", "webapp_logs", "appliance_logs") ("search" OR "query" OR "find" OR "grep") ("password" OR "credential" OR "key" OR "secret" OR "token"))```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
While detecting adversaries accessing credentials may be difficult without knowing they exist in the environment, it may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained. Monitor the command-line arguments of executing processes for suspicious words or regular expressions that may indicate searching for a password (for example: password, pwd, login, secure, or credentials). See Valid Accounts (T1078) for more information.

Analytic 1 - Suspicious commands or regular expressions indicating credential search.

``` (index=security sourcetype="Powershell" EventCode=4104) OR
(index=os sourcetype="linux_secure" action="execve") OR
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="execve") | where match(CommandLine, "(?i)(password|credential|secret|key|token|login|passwd|passphrase)")```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor newly executed processes that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.

Analytic 1 - New processes with parameters indicating credential searches.

``` (index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4688 CommandLine="*password*" OR CommandLine="*credential*") OR
(index=sysmon sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1 CommandLine="*password*" OR CommandLine="*credential*") OR
(index=os sourcetype="linux_audit" action="execve" CommandLine="*password*" OR CommandLine="*credential*") OR
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="execve" CommandLine="*password*" OR CommandLine="*credential*")```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for suspicious file access activity, specifically indications that a process is reading multiple files in a short amount of time and/or using command-line arguments indicative of searching for credential material (ex: regex patterns). These may be indicators of automated/scripted credential access behavior. Monitoring when the user's ```.bash_history``` is read can help alert to suspicious activity. While users do typically rely on their history of commands, they often access this history through other utilities like "history" instead of commands like ```cat ~/.bash_history```.

Analytic 1 - Multiple file reads in a short period or searching for credential material.

``` (index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4663 ObjectName="*password*" OR ObjectName="*credential*") OR
(index=sysmon sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=11 TargetObject="*password*" OR TargetObject="*credential*") OR
(index=os sourcetype="linux_audit" action="open" filepath IN ("*password*", "*credential*", "*passwd*", "*shadow*", "*.pem", "*.key")) OR
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="open" file_path IN ("*password*", "*credential*", "*passwd*", "*shadow*", "*.pem", "*.key"))```

#### User Account: User Account Authentication (DS0002): 
Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.

Analytic 1 - Failed or unusual logon attempts using compromised credentials.

```(index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode IN (4625, 4648)) OR
(index=os sourcetype="linux_secure" message="Failed password" OR message="Invalid user") OR
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="authentication_failure" OR message="Failed to authenticate user") ```
