# Data Transfer Size Limits (T1030)

## Description
An adversary may exfiltrate data in fixed size chunks instead of whole files or limit packet sizes below certain thresholds. This approach may be used to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts.

## Tactics
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

## Mitigations
- Network Intrusion Prevention (M1031)

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). If a process maintains a long connection during which it consistently sends fixed size data packets or a process opens connections and sends fixed sized data packets at regular intervals, it may be performing an aggregate data transfer. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for processes that initiate persistent outbound connections with steady data transfer, multiple small-sized data transfers within a short timeframe to external destinations, network connections originating from unexpected processes or unauthorized ports, or repeated use of the same destination for outbound traffic across multiple sessions.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Repeated Small-Size Data Transfers

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (bytes_out > 100 AND bytes_out < 50000)  // Detects small packet sizes  
| bucket span=5m _time
| stats count by _time, host, process, dest_ip, bytes_out
| where count > 10  // Ensures frequent occurrence
| stats count by host, dest_ip, count, earliest(_time), latest(_time)
| where count >= 10
| eval risk_score=case(
    count >= 20, 9,
    count >= 10, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, count, earliest, latest, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze traffic flows that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, or gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).

Analytic 1 - Detecting Timed Small-Sized Data Transfers for Exfiltration

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (bytes_out > 100 AND bytes_out < 50000)
| bucket span=10m _time
| stats count, sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, dest_ip
| where count > 5  // Ensures repeated transfers within 10-minute intervals
| stats count by host, dest_ip, total_bytes, earliest(_time), latest(_time)
| where count >= 5
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 500000, 9,
    total_bytes > 100000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, earliest, latest, risk_score```
