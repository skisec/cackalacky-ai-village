# ESXi Administration Command (T1675)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse ESXi administration services to execute commands on guest machines hosted within an ESXi virtual environment. Persistent background services on ESXi-hosted VMs, such as the VMware Tools Daemon Service, allow for remote management from the ESXi server. The tools daemon service runs as `vmtoolsd.exe` on Windows guest operating systems, `vmware-tools-daemon` on macOS, and `vmtoolsd ` on Linux. 

Adversaries may leverage a variety of tools to execute commands on ESXi-hosted VMs â€“ for example, by using the vSphere Web Services SDK to programmatically execute commands and scripts via APIs such as `StartProgramInGuest`, `ListProcessesInGuest`,  `ListFileInGuest`, and `InitiateFileTransferFromGuest`. This may enable follow-on behaviors on the guest VMs, such as File and Directory Discovery (T1083), Data from Local System (T1005), or OS Credential Dumping (T1003). 

## Tactics
- Execution (TA0002)

## Mitigations
- User Account Management (M1018)

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor for Guest Operations API calls executed from the ESXi host to a guest VM, especially:
- `StartProgramInGuest`
- `ListProcessesInGuest`
- `InitiateFileTransferFromGuest`
- `ListFileInGuest`

Sudden usage from ESXi management accounts (especially out of hours). Use of Guest Ops on VMs where `vmtoolsd` is not typically used or disabled. Operations from unusual ESXi IPs or using credentials not normally associated with VM management. 

Analytic 1 - ESXi Abuse
