# LSA Secrets (T1003.004)

## Description
Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts. LSA secrets are stored in the registry at ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets```. LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.

Reg can be used to extract from the Registry. Mimikatz can be used to extract secrets from memory.

## Detection
Monitor processes and command-line arguments for program execution that may be indicative of credential dumping. Remote access tools may contain built-in features or incorporate existing tools like Mimikatz. PowerShell scripts also exist that contain credential dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz module, which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Access (DS0024): 
Monitor for the LSA secrets are stored in the registry at ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets``` being accessed

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized registry access to LSA secrets.

``` index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4663 ObjectName="*\\Policy\\Secrets*" | where ProcessName IN ("reg.exe", "powershell.exe", "wmic.exe", "schtasks.exe", "cmd.exe", "rundll32.exe", "mimikatz.exe", "procdump.exe") ```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets. Remote access tools may contain built-in features or incorporate existing tools like Mimikatz. PowerShell scripts also exist that contain credential dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz module, which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.

Analytic 1 - Suspicious access to LSA secrets.

``` index=security (sourcetype="Powershell" EventCode=4104) Image="*powershell.exe" CommandLine IN ("*Invoke-Mimikatz*", "*Invoke-LSADump*")```
