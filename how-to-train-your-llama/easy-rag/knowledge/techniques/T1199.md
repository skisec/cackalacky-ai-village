# Trusted Relationship (T1199)

## Description
Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.

Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, Valid Accounts (T1078) used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.

In Office 365 environments, organizations may grant Microsoft partners or resellers delegated administrator permissions. By compromising a partner or reseller account, an adversary may be able to leverage existing delegated administrator relationships or send new delegated administrator offers to clients in order to gain administrative control over the victim tenant.

## Detection
Establish monitoring for activity conducted by second and third party providers and other trusted entities that may be leveraged as a means to gain access to the network. Depending on the type of relationship, an adversary may have access to significant amounts of information about the target before conducting an operation, especially if the trusted relationship is based on IT services. Adversaries may be able to act quickly towards an objective, so proper monitoring for behavior related to Credential Access, Lateral Movement, and Collection will be important to detect the intrusion.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior that may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Suspicious Logins from Trusted 3rd parties

``` (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625) 
OR (source="/var/log/auth.log" OR source="/var/log/secure" "sshd")
OR (source="o365_audit_logs" operation="UserLoggedIn")
OR (source="aws_cloudtrail" eventName="ConsoleLogin")
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(User, "%thirdparty%"), 8,
    failed_attempts > 5, 7,
    geo_location!="expected_location", 6
)
| where risk_score >= 6
| stats count by _time, host, User, geo_location, risk_score```

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Metadata (DS0028): 
Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).

Analytic 1 - Detecting abnormal session activity from trusted accounts 

```(EventCode=4776) 
OR (source="o365_audit_logs" operation IN ("RefreshTokenUsed", "MFABypassed"))
OR (source="aws_cloudtrail" eventName IN ("GetSessionToken", "AssumeRole"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    session_duration > 12*3600, 7,
    multiple_locations_within_10min=true, 8,
    mfa_bypass=true, 9
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, User, session_duration, mfa_bypass, risk_score ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor network traffic associated with third-party provider access, focusing on unusual data transfers, remote session activity, and access to sensitive resources. Identify unexpected communication patterns, data exfiltration attempts, or traffic to/from suspicious IP addresses.

Analytic 1 - Detecting unusual network activity from trusted 3rd parties 

```(EventCode=3)
OR (source="/var/log/zeek/conn.log" "SSH")
OR (source="aws_vpc_logs" dest_port IN (3389, 22, 443))
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(src_ip, "%thirdparty%"), 8,
    lateral_movement_detected=true, 7,
    new_connection_from_cloud=true, 9
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, src_ip, dest_ip, protocol, risk_score ```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Configuration management databases (CMDB) and other asset management systems may help with the detection of computer systems or network devices that should not exist on a network. Monitor logs for unexpected actions taken by any delegated administrator accounts.
