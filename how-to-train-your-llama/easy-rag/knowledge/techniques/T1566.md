# Phishing (T1566)

## Description
Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source, as well as evasive techniques such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages (e.g., Email Hiding Rules (T1564.008)). Another way to accomplish this is by Email Spoofing (T1672) the identity of the sender, which can be used to fool both the human recipient as well as automated security tools, or by including the intended target as a party to an existing email thread that includes malicious files or links (i.e., "thread hijacking").

Victims may also receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a phone number where they are directed to visit a malicious URL, download malware, or install adversary-accessible remote management tools onto their computer (i.e., User Execution (T1204)).

## Detection
Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect phishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.

Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.

URL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can help detect links leading to known malicious sites. Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.

Because most common third-party services used for phishing via service leverage TLS encryption, SSL/TLS inspection is generally required to detect the initial communication/delivery. With SSL/TLS inspection intrusion detection signatures or other security gateway appliances may be able to detect malware.

Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded on the user's computer. Many possible detections of follow-on behavior may take place once User Execution (T1204) occurs.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for creation of suspicious email attachments in download directories, execution of phishing attachments (e.g., .docm, .lnk, .hta, .vbs), or files extracted from .zip, .rar, .iso containers that execute scripts.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Malicious File Creation from Phishing Emails

```(EventCode=11 OR EventCode=1116)
OR (source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" SYSCALL="open" path IN ("/home/user/Downloads", "C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(path, "%.vbs"), 8,
    like(path, "%.lnk"), 7,
    like(path, "%.exe"), 6
)
| where risk_score >= 6
| stats count by _time, host, path, user, risk_score ``` 

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Malicious Network Traffic Post-Phishing Execution

```(EventCode=3)
OR (source="zeek_conn.log" dest_ip IN (malicious_ip_list))
OR (source="proxy_logs" url IN (malicious_url_list))
| eval risk_score=case(
    dest_ip IN (malicious_ip_list), 9,
    dest_port IN (4444, 1337, 8080), 8,
    user_agent LIKE "%curl%", 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, user, dest_ip, dest_port, risk_score ```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed. URL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can help detect links leading to known malicious sites. Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.

Monitor call logs from corporate devices to identify patterns of potential voice phishing, such as calls to/from known malicious phone numbers. Correlate these records with system events.

```(source="o365_message_trace" OR source="gmail_security_logs" OR source="/var/log/maillog")
| search ("dkim=fail" OR "spf=fail" OR "dmarc=fail" OR "suspicious attachment")
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(subject, "%password reset%"), 8,
    like(subject, "%urgent action required%"), 7,
    like(subject, "%invoice%"), 6
)
| where risk_score >= 6
| stats count by _time, src_email, dest_email, subject, attachment_name, risk_score ``` 

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor for clicking on malicious links leading to credential phishing, traffic to newly registered or suspicious domains, malicious redirect chains embedded in emails, or downloading of executables from phishing sites.

``` (EventCode=3)
OR (source="zeek_http_logs" uri IN (malicious_url_list))
OR (source="proxy_logs" url IN (malicious_url_list))
| eval risk_score=case(
    domain IN ("bit.ly", "tinyurl.com"), 8,
    domain IN ("*.xyz", "*.top"), 7,
    uri IN (malicious_url_list), 9
