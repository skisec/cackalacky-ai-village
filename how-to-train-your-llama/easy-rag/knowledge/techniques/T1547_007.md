# Re-opened Applications (T1547.007)

## Description
Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to "Reopen windows when logging back in". When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named ```com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist``` within the ```~/Library/Preferences/ByHost``` directory. Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the userâ€™s next logon.

Adversaries can establish Persistence (TA0003) by adding a malicious application path to the ```com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist``` file to execute payloads when a user logs in.
