# Transfer Data to Cloud Account (T1537)

## Description
Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including through sharing/syncing and creating backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service.

A defender who is monitoring for large transfers to outside the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider. Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.

Adversaries may also use cloud-native mechanisms to share victim data with adversary-controlled cloud accounts, such as creating anonymous file sharing links or, in Azure, a shared access signature (SAS) URI.

Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.

## Detection
Monitor account activity for attempts to share data, snapshots, or backups with untrusted or unusual accounts on the same cloud service provider. Monitor for anomalous file transfer activity between accounts and to untrusted VPCs. 

In AWS, sharing an Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshot, either with specified users or publicly, generates a ModifySnapshotAttribute event in CloudTrail logs. Similarly, in Azure, creating a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URI for a Virtual Hard Disk (VHS) snapshot generates a "Get Snapshot SAS URL" event in Activity Logs.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage Modification (DS0010): 
Monitor for anomalous file transfer activity between accounts and/or to untrusted/unexpected VPCs.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Cloud Storage Permission Changes for Exfiltration

``` (EventCode="PutBucketPolicy" OR EventCode="ModifyStoragePermissions" OR source="Google_Admin_Logs")
| where (action IN ("modify_acl", "change_permissions", "public_read_enabled"))
| stats count by _time, host, user, action, storage_name
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    action="public_read_enabled", 9,
    action="modify_acl", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table _time, host, user, action, storage_name, risk_score```

#### Snapshot: Snapshot Creation (DS0020): 
Monitor account activity for attempts to create and share data, such as snapshots or backups, with untrusted or unusual accounts.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Suspicious Snapshot Exfiltration

```(EventCode="CreateSnapshot" OR EventCode="ModifySnapshotAttribute" OR source="Google_Admin_Logs")
| where (action IN ("create_snapshot", "modify_snapshot_acl", "backup_created"))
| stats count by _time, host, user, action, snapshot_name
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    snapshot_name LIKE "%backup%" OR snapshot_name LIKE "%export%", 9,
    snapshot_name LIKE "%snapshot%", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table _time, host, user, action, snapshot_name, risk_score ```

#### Snapshot: Snapshot Modification (DS0020): 
Monitor account activity for attempts to share data, snapshots, or backups with untrusted or unusual accounts on the same cloud service provider. Monitor for anomalous file transfer activity between accounts and to untrusted VPCs.

#### Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage Metadata (DS0010): 
Periodically baseline cloud storage infrastructure to identify malicious modifications or additions.

#### Snapshot: Snapshot Metadata (DS0020): 
Periodically baseline snapshots to identify malicious modifications or additions.

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor logs for SaaS applications to detect instances of data being shared inappropriately. For example, in Microsoft 365, file sharing events will appear in Audit logs under the event names `SharingInvitationCreated`, `AnonymousLinkCreated`, `SecureLinkCreated`, or `AddedToSecureLink`, with `TargetUserOrGroupType` being `Guest.`  In Google Workspace, externally shared files will have a `Visibility` property of `Shared externally` in the Drive audit logs.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Cloud Data Sharing with External Accounts

``` (EventCode="ModifySnapshotAttribute" OR EventCode="PutBucketAcl" OR EventCode="CreateSharedAccessSignature")
| where (action IN ("share", "modify_acl", "create_sas_url"))
| stats count by _time, host, user, action, destination_account, object_type
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    action IN ("share", "create_sas_url") AND destination_account NOT IN (trusted_accounts), 9,
    action IN ("modify_acl"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table _time, host, user, action, destination_account, object_type, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor network traffic content for evidence of data exfiltration, such as gratuitous or anomalous internal traffic containing collected data. Consider correlation with process monitoring and command lines associated with collection and exfiltration.

#### Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage Creation (DS0010): 
Monitor account activity for attempts to create and share data, such as snapshots or backups, with untrusted or unusual accounts.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Creation of Storage for Exfiltration

``` (EventCode="CreateBucket" OR EventCode="StorageAccountCreated" OR source="Google_Admin_Logs")
| where (action IN ("create_bucket", "create_storage_account", "create_shared_drive"))
| stats count by _time, host, user, action, storage_name
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    storage_name LIKE "%backup%" OR storage_name LIKE "%export%", 9,
    storage_name LIKE "%temp%" OR storage_name LIKE "%new%", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table _time, host, user, action, storage_name, risk_score```
