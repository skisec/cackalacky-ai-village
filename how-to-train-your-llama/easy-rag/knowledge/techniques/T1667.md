# Email Bombing (T1667)

## Description
Adversaries may flood targeted email addresses with an overwhelming volume of messages. This may bury legitimate emails in a flood of spam and disrupt business operations.

An adversary may accomplish email bombing by leveraging an automated bot to register a targeted address for e-mail lists that do not validate new signups, such as online newsletters. The result can be a wave of thousands of e-mails that effectively overloads the victimâ€™s inbox.

By sending hundreds or thousands of e-mails in quick succession, adversaries may successfully divert attention away from and bury legitimate messages including security alerts, daily business processes like help desk tickets and client correspondence, or ongoing scams. This behavior can also be used as a tool of harassment.

This behavior may be a precursor for Spearphishing Voice (T1566.004). For example, an adversary may email bomb a target and then follow up with a phone call to fraudulently offer assistance. This social engineering may lead to the use of Remote Access Software (T1663) to steal credentials, deploy ransomware, conduct Financial Theft (T1657), or engage in other malicious activity.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor e-mail logs for an abnormally high volume of messages or message content sent to specific victim e-mail addresses or servers.

Analytic 1 - Spike in Email Volume 
``` index=email_logs sourcetype="mail:log"
| timechart span=5m count by recipient_email
| eventstats avg(count) as avg_count stdev(count) as std_dev by recipient_email
| eval spike=if(count > avg_count + (3*std_dev), 1, 0)
| search spike=1
| table _time, recipient_email, count, avg_count, std_dev ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Abnormal spikes in incoming traffic volume to specific victim e-mail addresses or servers may indicate an email bombing attempt.

Analytic 1 - Suspicious network traffic 

``` sourcetype="zeek:conn" dest_port=25 OR dest_port=465 OR dest_port=587
| stats count avg(bytes_in) by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, _time
| eventstats avg(count) as avg_flows, stdev(count) as std_flows by dest_ip
| eval anomaly=if(count > avg_flows + (2*std_flows), 1, 0)
| search anomaly=1
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, count, avg_flows ```

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for 
- Attachment creation events with excessive or repetitive file creation
- Unusual file size from email messages (e.g., base64-encoded attachments dumped locally)
- Burst of .eml, .msg, .tmp file extensions in mail client folders

Analytic 1 - Email file creations 

``` EventCode=11 (file_name="*.eml" OR file_name="*.msg" OR file_name="*.tmp")
| stats count avg(file_size) max(file_size) by user, file_path, process_name, _time
| where count > 100 OR max(file_size) > 1000000
| table _time, user, process_name, file_path, file_name, count, max(file_size)```
