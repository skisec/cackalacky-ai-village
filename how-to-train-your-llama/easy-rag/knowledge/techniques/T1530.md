# Data from Cloud Storage (T1530)

## Description
Adversaries may access data from cloud storage.

Many IaaS providers offer solutions for online data object storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. Similarly, SaaS enterprise platforms such as Office 365 and Google Workspace provide cloud-based document storage to users through services such as OneDrive and Google Drive, while SaaS application providers such as Slack, Confluence, Salesforce, and Dropbox may provide cloud storage solutions as a peripheral or primary use case of their platform. 

In some cases, as with IaaS-based cloud storage, there exists no overarching application (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) with which to interact with the stored objects: instead, data from these solutions is retrieved directly though the Cloud API (T1059.009). In SaaS applications, adversaries may be able to collect this data directly from APIs or backend cloud storage objects, rather than through their front-end application or interface (i.e., Data from Information Repositories (T1213)). 

Adversaries may collect sensitive data from these cloud storage solutions. Providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems, though misconfigurations are a common problem. There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured, typically by unintentionally allowing public access to unauthenticated users, overly-broad access by all users, or even access for any anonymous person outside the control of the Identity Access Management system without even needing basic user permissions.

This open access may expose various types of sensitive data, such as credit cards, personally identifiable information, or medical records.

Adversaries may also obtain then abuse leaked credentials from source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects.

- Filter Network Traffic (M1037)
- Audit (M1047)
- Multi-factor Authentication (M1032)

## Detection
Monitor for unusual queries to the cloud provider's storage service. Activity originating from unexpected sources may indicate improper permissions are set that is allowing access to data. Additionally, detecting failed attempts by a user for a certain object, followed by escalation of privileges by the same user, and access to the same object may be an indication of suspicious activity.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Cloud Service: Cloud Service Metadata (DS0025): 
Monitor M365 Audit logs for TeamsSessionStarted Operations against MicrosoftTeams workloads involving suspicious ClientIPs and suspect accounts (UserId).

Analytic 1 - Sessions initiated from unusual IP addresses, high volume of sessions from a single account, sessions at unusual times

``` "`index=""m365_audit_logs"" Operation=""TeamsSessionStarted""
| stats count by UserId, ClientIP, CreationTime
| where ClientIP!=""expected_ip"" OR UserId!=""expected_user""
| sort by CreationTime"```

#### Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage Access (DS0010): 
Monitor for unusual queries to the cloud provider's storage service. Activity originating from unexpected sources may indicate improper permissions are set and are allowing access to data. Additionally, detecting failed attempts by a user for a certain object, followed by escalation of privileges by the same user, and access to the same object may be an indication of suspicious activity.
