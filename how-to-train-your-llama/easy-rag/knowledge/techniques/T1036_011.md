# Overwrite Process Arguments (T1036.011)

## Description
Adversaries may modify a process's in-memory arguments to change its name in order to appear as a legitimate or benign process. On Linux, the operating system stores command-line arguments in the processâ€™s stack and passes them to the `main()` function as the `argv` array. The first element, `argv[0]`, typically contains the process name or path - by default, the command used to actually start the process (e.g., `cat /etc/passwd`). By default, the Linux `/proc` filesystem uses this value to represent the process name. The `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` file reflects the contents of this memory, and tools like `ps` use it to display process information. Since arguments are stored in user-space memory at launch, this modification can be performed without elevated privileges. 

During runtime, adversaries can erase the memory used by all command-line arguments for a process, overwriting each argument string with null bytes. This removes evidence of how the process was originally launched. They can then write a spoofed string into the memory region previously occupied by `argv[0]` to mimic a benign command, such as `cat resolv.conf`. The new command-line string is reflected in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` and displayed by tools like `ps`.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Metadata (DS0009): 
Compare `/proc/<PID>/comm` (which reflects the process name), `cmdline` (which reflects `argv[0]`), and the actual binary (`/proc/<PID>/exe`) to detect inconsistencies. Combine with the activity of clearing `argv[1..n]` early in execution.
