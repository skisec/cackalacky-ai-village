# Exfiltration Over Physical Medium (T1052)

## Description
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data via a physical medium, such as a removable drive. In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a physical medium or device introduced by a user. Such media could be an external hard drive, USB drive, cellular phone, MP3 player, or other removable storage and processing device. The physical medium or device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.

## Sub-techniques
- Exfiltration over USB (T1052.001)

## Tactics
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

## Mitigations
- Data Loss Prevention (M1057)
- Limit Hardware Installation (M1034)
- Disable or Remove Feature or Program (M1042)

## Detection
Monitor file access on removable media. Detect processes that execute when removable media are mounted.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor file access on removable media that may attempt to exfiltrate data via a physical medium, such as a removable drive.

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Access to Removable Media

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/media/usb/*", "/mnt/usb/*", "D:\\USB\\*", "E:\\USB\\*"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_path LIKE "%/media/usb/%", 9,
    file_path LIKE "%D:\\USB\\%", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, risk_score```

#### Drive: Drive Creation (DS0016): 
Detection of newly mounted USB or external drives, unusual storage devices connected to a system (e.g., large capacity, high-speed), or frequent device mount/unmount activity indicative of exfiltration attempts.

Analytic 1 - Detecting New External Drive Mounting Events

``` (EventCode=6 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/syslog" "usb-storage added" OR source="com.apple.DiskArbitration")
| where (device_type IN ("USB", "Removable Storage"))
| stats count by _time, host, user, device_name, device_type
| eval risk_score=case(
    device_type="USB", 9,
    device_type="Removable Storage", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, user, device_name, device_type, risk_score```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for processes triggered when external storage is connected, autorun scripts executed from USB drives, or file explorer or PowerShell processes interacting with external storage.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Processes Executed from USB Devices 

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (process_name IN ("explorer.exe", "powershell.exe", "cmd.exe", "bash", "sh") AND process_path LIKE "/media/usb/%")
| eval risk_score=case(
    process_path LIKE "/media/usb/%", 9,
    process_path LIKE "D:\\USB\\%", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, process_name, process_path, risk_score```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for execution of file transfer commands (robocopy, xcopy, cp, rsync) targeting removable media, use of disk utilities (diskpart, mount, mkfs) to format or prepare devices, or PowerShell or bash scripts automating file transfers to USB devices.

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Transfers to Removable Media via Command Execution 

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("robocopy", "xcopy", "cp", "rsync", "mount", "diskutil"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("robocopy", "cp", "rsync"), 9,
    command IN ("mount", "diskutil"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```
