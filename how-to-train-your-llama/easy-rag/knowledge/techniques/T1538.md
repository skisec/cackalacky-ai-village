# Cloud Service Dashboard (T1538)

## Description
An adversary may use a cloud service dashboard GUI with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features. For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, review findings of potential security risks, and run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.

Depending on the configuration of the environment, an adversary may be able to enumerate more information via the graphical dashboard than an API. This also allows the adversary to gain information without manually making any API requests.

## Tactics

## Detection
Monitor account activity logs to see actions performed and activity associated with the cloud service management console. Some cloud providers, such as AWS, provide distinct log events for login attempts to the management console.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior across cloud service management consoles. In AWS environments, look for the `ConsoleLogin` sign-in event. 

#### User Account: User Account Authentication (DS0002): 
Correlate other security systems with login information, such as user accounts, IP addresses, and login names.
