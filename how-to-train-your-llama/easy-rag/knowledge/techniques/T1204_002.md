# Malicious File (T1204.002)

## Description
An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001). Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, .cpl, and .reg.

Adversaries may employ various forms of Masquerading (T1036) and Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) to increase the likelihood that a user will open and successfully execute a malicious file. These methods may include using a familiar naming convention and/or password protecting the file and supplying instructions to a user on how to open it. 

While Malicious File (T1204.002) frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after Internal Spearphishing (T1534).

## Detection
Monitor the execution of and command-line arguments for applications that may be used by an adversary to gain initial access that require user interaction. This includes compression applications, such as those for zip files, that can be used to Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140) in payloads.

Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded and executed on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the file is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning powershell.exe).

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for processes spawned after opening a suspicious file. Common applications that might be exploited are Microsoft Word, PDF readers, or compression utilities.

Analytic 1 - Processes created from malicious files.

``` (sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4688) OR (sourcetype=Sysmon EventCode=1)
| search process_name IN ("WINWORD.EXE", "EXCEL.EXE", "PDFReader.exe", "7z.exe", "powershell.exe", "cmd.exe")
| stats count by process_name parent_process_name command_line user
| where parent_process_name IN ("explorer.exe", "outlook.exe", "thunderbird.exe")```

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for files created in unusual directories or files with suspicious extensions. Focus on common locations like the Downloads folder, Temp directories, or the user’s Desktop, especially files that would be of interest from spearphishing attachments.

While batch files are not inherently malicious, it is uncommon to see them created after OS installation, especially in the Windows directory. This analytic looks for the suspicious activity of a batch file being created within the C:\Windows\System32 directory tree. There will be only occasional false positives due to administrator actions.

For MacOS, utilities that work in concert with Apple’s Endpoint Security Framework such as File Monitor can be used to track file creation events.

Analytic 1 - Batch File Write to System32

``` (sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode="11") file_path="*system32*" AND file_extension=".bat"```

Analytic 2 - New file creation in unusual directories.

```sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=11
| search file_path IN ("*/Downloads/*", "*/Temp/*", "*/Desktop/*")
| stats count by file_name file_extension file_path user
| where file_extension IN ("doc", "docx", "pdf", "xls", "rtf", "exe", "scr", "lnk", "pif", "cpl", "zip") ```
