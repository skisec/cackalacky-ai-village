# Gather Victim Org Information (T1591)

## Description
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's organization that can be used during targeting. Information about an organization may include a variety of details, including the names of divisions/departments, specifics of business operations, as well as the roles and responsibilities of key employees.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information (T1598). Information about an organization may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media (T1593.001) or Search Victim-Owned Websites (T1594)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information (T1598) or Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: Establish Accounts (T1585) or Compromise Accounts (T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: Phishing (T1566) or Trusted Relationship (T1199)).

## Detection

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
