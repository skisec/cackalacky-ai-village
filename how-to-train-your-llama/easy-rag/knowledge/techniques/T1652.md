# Device Driver Discovery (T1652)

## Description
Adversaries may attempt to enumerate local device drivers on a victim host. Information about device drivers may highlight various insights that shape follow-on behaviors, such as the function/purpose of the host, present security tools (i.e. Security Software Discovery (T1518.001)) or other defenses (e.g., Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (T1497)), as well as potential exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)).

Many OS utilities may provide information about local device drivers, such as `driverquery.exe` and the `EnumDeviceDrivers()` API function on Windows. Information about device drivers (as well as associated services, i.e., System Service Discovery (T1007)) may also be available in the Registry.

On Linux/macOS, device drivers (in the form of kernel modules) may be visible within `/dev` or using utilities such as `lsmod` and `modinfo`.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands (`lsmod`, `driverquery`, etc.) with arguments highlighting potentially malicious attempts to enumerate device drivers.

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor processes (`lsmod`, `driverquery.exe`, etc.) for events that may highlight potentially malicious attempts to enumerate device drivers.

#### Process: OS API Execution (DS0009): 
Monitor for API calls (such as `EnumDeviceDrivers()`) that may attempt to gather information about local device drivers.

#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Access (DS0024): 
Monitor for attempts to access information stored in the Registry about devices and their associated drivers, such as values under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services` and `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\HardwareProfiles`.
