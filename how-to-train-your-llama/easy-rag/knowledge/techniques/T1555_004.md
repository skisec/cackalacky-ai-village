# Windows Credential Manager (T1555.004)

## Description
Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).

The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers. As part of Credentials from Web Browsers (T1555.003), Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker. Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.

Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted `.vcrd` files, located under `%Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\`. The encryption key can be found in a file named ```Policy.vpol```, typically located in the same folder as the credentials.

Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms. ```vaultcmd.exe``` is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface. Adversaries may also gather credentials by directly reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers. Windows APIs, such as ```CredEnumerateA```, may also be absued to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.

Adversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups. Credential backups and restorations may be performed by running ```rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr``` then selecting the “Back up...” button on the “Stored User Names and Passwords” GUI.

Password recovery tools may also obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.

## Detection
Monitor process and command-line parameters of ```vaultcmd.exe``` for suspicious activity, such as listing credentials from the Windows Credentials locker (i.e., ```vaultcmd /listcreds:“Windows Credentials”```).

Consider monitoring API calls such as ```CredEnumerateA``` that may list credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.

Consider monitoring file reads to Vault locations, ```%Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\```, for suspicious activity.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Consider monitoring file reads to Vault locations, ```&percnt;Systemdrive&percnt;&bsol;Users&bsol;&bsol;&lsqb;Username&rsqb;&bsol;AppData&bsol;Local&bsol;Microsoft&bsol;&bsol;&lsqb;Vault&sol;Credentials&rsqb;&bsol;```, for suspicious activity.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized access to Windows Vault credential files.

``` index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" event_type="file_access"
(file_path IN ("%SystemDrive%\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Vault\\*\\*.vcrd", "%SystemDrive%\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\*\\*.vcrd", "%SystemDrive%\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Vault\\*\\Policy.vpol", "%SystemDrive%\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\*\\Policy.vpol"))```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments for suspicious activity listing credentials from the Windows Credentials locker (e.g. ```vaultcmd /listcreds:“Windows Credentials”```).

Analytic 1 - Commands indicating credential searches in Windows Credential Manager.

``` index=security sourcetype="Powershell" EventCode=4104
(CommandLine IN ("*vaultcmd.exe*", "*rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr*"))```

#### Process: OS API Execution (DS0009): 
Consider monitoring API calls such as ```CredEnumerateA``` that may list credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.

Analytic 1 - Suspicious API calls related to Windows Credential Manager access.

``` index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" event_type="api_call"
(api IN ("CredEnumerateA", "CredEnumerateW", "CredReadA", "CredReadW", "CryptUnprotectData"))```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor newly executed processes for suspicious activity listing credentials from the Windows Credentials locker (e.g. ```vaultcmd /listcreds:“Windows Credentials”```).

Analytic 1 - New processes with parameters indicating credential searches in Windows Credential Manager.

``` index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1
(CommandLine IN ("*vaultcmd.exe*", "*rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr*"))```
