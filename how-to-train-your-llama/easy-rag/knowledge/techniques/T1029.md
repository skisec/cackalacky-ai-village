# Scheduled Transfer (T1029)

## Description
Adversaries may schedule data exfiltration to be performed only at certain times of day or at certain intervals. This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.

When scheduled exfiltration is used, other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) or Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048).

## Tactics
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

## Mitigations
- Network Intrusion Prevention (M1031)

## Detection
Monitor process file access patterns and network behavior. Unrecognized processes or scripts that appear to be traversing file systems and sending network traffic may be suspicious. Network connections to the same destination that occur at the same time of day for multiple days are suspicious.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.

Analytic 1 - Detecting High Volume Exfiltration at Specific Intervals 

```(EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (bytes_out > 10000000)
| bucket span=1h _time
| stats sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, dest_ip
| where total_bytes > 100000000
| stats count by host, dest_ip, total_bytes, earliest(_time), latest(_time)
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 500000000, 9,
    total_bytes > 100000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, earliest, latest, risk_score ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for repeated outbound connections to the same destination at scheduled intervals, connections from processes that typically do not initiate network communications, transfers using non-standard ports or unexpected encryption methods.

``` (EventCode=3)
OR (source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (dest_ip IN (suspicious_ip_list) OR bytes_out > 5000000)
| bucket span=1h _time
| stats count by _time, host, process, dest_ip, bytes_out
| where count > 3
| stats count by host, dest_ip, count, earliest(_time), latest(_time)
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    count >= 5, 9,
    count = 3 OR 4, 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| table host, dest_ip, count, earliest, latest, risk_score```
