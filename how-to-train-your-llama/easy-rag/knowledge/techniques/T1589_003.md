# Employee Names (T1589.003)

## Description
Adversaries may gather employee names that can be used during targeting. Employee names be used to derive email addresses as well as to help guide other reconnaissance efforts and/or craft more-believable lures.

Adversaries may easily gather employee names, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media (T1593.001) or Search Victim-Owned Websites (T1594)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593) or Phishing for Information (T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: Compromise Accounts (T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: Phishing (T1566) or Valid Accounts (T1078)).

## Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
