# Compromise Hardware Supply Chain (T1195.003)

## Description
Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.

## Parent Technique
- Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)

## Tactics
- Initial Access (TA0001)

## Mitigations
- Boot Integrity (M1046)

## Detection
Perform physical inspection of hardware to look for potential tampering. Perform integrity checking on pre-OS boot mechanisms that can be manipulated for malicious purposes.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Sensor Health: Host Status (DS0013): 
Perform physical inspection of hardware to look for potential tampering. Perform integrity checking on pre-OS boot mechanisms that can be manipulated for malicious purposes and and compare against known good baseline behavior.
