# Data from Configuration Repository (T1602)

## Description
Adversaries may collect data related to managed devices from configuration repositories. Configuration repositories are used by management systems in order to configure, manage, and control data on remote systems. Configuration repositories may also facilitate remote access and administration of devices.

Adversaries may target these repositories in order to collect large quantities of sensitive system administration data. Data from configuration repositories may be exposed by various protocols and software and can store a wide variety of data, much of which may align with adversary Discovery objectives.

## Sub-techniques
- Network Device Configuration Dump (T1602.002)
- SNMP (MIB Dump) (T1602.001)

## Tactics
- Collection (TA0009)

## Mitigations
- Update Software (M1051)
- Software Configuration (M1054)
- Network Segmentation (M1030)
- Filter Network Traffic (M1037)
- Network Intrusion Prevention (M1031)
- Encrypt Sensitive Information (M1041)

## Detection
Identify network traffic sent or received by untrusted hosts or networks that solicits and obtains the configuration information of the queried device.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g. unauthorized, gratuitous, or anomalous traffic patterns attempting to access configuration content)

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts or uncommon data flows. Consider analyzing packet contents to detect application layer protocols, leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g. unauthorized, gratuitous, or anomalous traffic patterns attempting to access configuration content)
