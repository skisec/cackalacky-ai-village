# SQL Stored Procedures (T1505.001)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems. SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries. Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application is started/restarted).

Adversaries may craft malicious stored procedures that can provide a persistence mechanism in SQL database servers. To execute operating system commands through SQL syntax the adversary may have to enable additional functionality, such as xp_cmdshell for MSSQL Server. 

Microsoft SQL Server can enable common language runtime (CLR) integration. With CLR integration enabled, application developers can write stored procedures using any .NET framework language (e.g. VB .NET, C#, etc.). Adversaries may craft or modify CLR assemblies that are linked to stored procedures since these CLR assemblies can be made to execute arbitrary commands. 

## Parent Technique
- Server Software Component (T1505)

## Tactics
- Persistence (TA0003)

## Mitigations
- Audit (M1047)
- Code Signing (M1045)
- Privileged Account Management (M1026)

## Detection
On a MSSQL Server, consider monitoring for xp_cmdshell usage. Consider enabling audit features that can log malicious startup activities.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems. On a MSSQL Server, consider monitoring for xp_cmdshell usage. Consider enabling audit features that can log malicious startup activities.
