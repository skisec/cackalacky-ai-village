# Network Trust Dependencies (T1590.003)

## Description
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network trust dependencies that can be used during targeting. Information about network trusts may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains (ex: managed service providers, contractors, etc.) that have connected (and potentially elevated) network access.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information (T1598). Information about network trusts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Search Open Technical Databases (T1596)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Active Scanning (T1595) or Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: Acquire Infrastructure (T1583) or Compromise Infrastructure (T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: Trusted Relationship (T1199)).

## Parent Technique
- Gather Victim Network Information (T1590)

## Tactics
- Reconnaissance (TA0043)

## Mitigations
- Pre-compromise (M1056)

## Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
