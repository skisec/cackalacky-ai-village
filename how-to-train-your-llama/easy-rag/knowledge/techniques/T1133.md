# External Remote Services (T1133)

## Description
Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as Windows Remote Management (T1021.006) and VNC (T1021.005) can also be used externally.

Access to Valid Accounts (T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network. Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.

Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.

## Detection
Follow best practices for detecting adversary use of Valid Accounts (T1078) for authenticating to remote services. Collect authentication logs and analyze for unusual access patterns, windows of activity, and access outside of normal business hours.

When authentication is not required to access an exposed remote service, monitor for follow-on activities such as anomalous external use of the exposed API or application.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections that may use Valid Accounts to access and/or persist within a network using External Remote Services. Use of External Remote Services may be legitimate depending on the environment and how it’s used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior using External Remote Services.

Analytic 1 - Connections to common remote service ports 

``` index=network sourcetype="network_traffic"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, protocol
| where dest_port=22 OR dest_port=3389 OR dest_port=8443
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, protocol ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Track the flow of traffic to/from external sources to detect anomalies or unusual patterns. Unusual patterns or high-volume traffic flows between internal and external systems.
Connections to/from known malicious IPs or geolocations.

Analytic 1 - High-Volume data transfers 

``` index=network sourcetype="network_traffic_flow"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, bytes_sent, bytes_received
| where bytes_sent > 1000000 OR bytes_received > 1000000
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, bytes_sent, bytes_received ```

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Metadata (DS0028): 
Follow best practices for detecting adversary use of Valid Accounts (T1078) for authenticating to remote services. Collect authentication logs and analyze for unusual access patterns, windows of activity, and access outside of normal business hours.

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
When authentication is not required to access an exposed remote service, monitor for follow-on activities such as anomalous external use of the exposed API or application.

Analytic 1 - Failed connection attempts from remote services 

``` index="remote_access_logs" sourcetype="vpn_logs" OR sourcetype="rdp_logs" OR sourcetype="citrix_logs"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, user, status, _time
| where status="failed" AND count > 5
| table _time, user, src_ip, dest_ip, status ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Analyze traffic to detect anomalous requests, API usage, or data transfers. Anomalous content within network traffic, such as unexpected API calls, file transfers, or large data uploads.
Unusual commands or payloads transmitted through remote service channels.

Analytic 1 - Large data transfers over remote service connections 

``` index=network sourcetype="network_packet_capture"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, data_size, protocol
| where data_size > 1000000
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, data_size, protocol ```
