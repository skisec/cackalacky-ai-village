# Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)

## Description
Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.

Web service providers also commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. User behavior monitoring may help to detect abnormal patterns of activity.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections to web and cloud services associated with abnormal or non-browser processes.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Large Data Transfers to Web Services 

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (dest_ip IN (known_cloud_services) AND bytes_out > 5000000)
| stats count, sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, process, dest_ip
| where total_bytes > 50000000
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 100000000, 9,
    total_bytes > 50000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, risk_score```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for execution of cloud storage CLI tools (e.g., AWS CLI, rclone, gdrive, azcopy, gsutil), scripts automating file transfers to cloud services, or use of PowerShell or Bash to upload files to external web services.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Web Service File Upload via CLI Tools

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("rclone copy", "aws s3 cp", "gsutil cp", "azcopy copy", "curl -T", "wget --post-file"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("rclone copy", "aws s3 cp"), 9,
    command IN ("curl -T", "wget --post-file"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for files being accessed by an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Staging Before Web Service Upload 

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/tmp/*", "/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_path LIKE "/tmp/%", 9,
    file_path LIKE "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, risk_score```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Review logs for SaaS services, including Office 365 and Google Workspace, to detect the configuration of new webhooks or other features that could be abused to exfiltrate data.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Large File Uploads to Web Services

``` (EventCode="FileUploaded" OR EventCode="PutObject" OR source="O365_audit" OR source="Google_Admin_Logs")
| where (file_size > 5000000)  // Detects files larger than 5MB  
| stats count by _time, host, user, action, service_name, file_size
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_size > 50000000, 9,  // High-risk large file transfer
    file_size > 5000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table _time, host, user, action, service_name, file_size, risk_score```
