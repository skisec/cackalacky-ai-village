# Scheduled Task/Job (T1053)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.

Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges). Similar to System Binary Proxy Execution (T1218), adversaries have also abused task scheduling to potentially mask one-time execution under a trusted system process.

## Detection
Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. 

Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Scheduled Job: Scheduled Job Creation (DS0003): 
Monitor newly constructed scheduled jobs that may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

On Windows systems, security event ID 4698 (A scheduled task was created) provides information on newly created scheduled tasks. It includes the TaskContent field, which contains an XML blob that captures key information on the scheduled task including the command to be executed.

Analytic 1 - Scheduled Task Execution

``` source="*WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=“4698” | where NOT (TaskName IN ("\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UpdateOrchestrator\\Reboot", "\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defrag\\ScheduledDefrag"))
| search TaskContent="powershell.exe" OR TaskContent="cmd.exe"```

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor newly constructed files that may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

Analytic 1 - Look for new task files with unusual parameters.

``` index=security_logs OR index=system_logs
(sourcetype="docker_events" OR sourcetype="kubernetes_events" OR sourcetype="wineventlog:security" OR sourcetype="linux_secure" OR sourcetype="syslog" OR sourcetype="file_monitoring")
| eval platform=case(
    sourcetype=="docker_events" OR sourcetype=="kubernetes_events", "Containers",
    sourcetype=="wineventlog:security", "Windows",
    sourcetype=="linux_secure" OR sourcetype=="syslog", "Linux",
    sourcetype=="mac_os_events", "macOS"
)
| search (
    (platform="Containers" AND (event_type="file_create" AND (file_path="*/etc/cron.d/*" OR file_path="*/etc/systemd/system/*"))) OR
    (platform="Windows" AND EventCode=4663 AND (ObjectName="C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\*" OR ObjectName="C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\*")) OR
    (platform="Linux" AND (file_path="/etc/cron.d/*" OR file_path="/etc/systemd/system/*")) OR
    (platform="macOS" AND (file_path="/Library/LaunchDaemons/*" OR file_path="/Library/LaunchAgents/*"))
)```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for newly executed processes that may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

Note: Below is the relevant Events and Sources
Windows:

- Sysmon Event ID 1: Process creation, particularly for schtasks.exe, at.exe, Taskeng.exe, crontab, etc.
- Windows Event Log EventCode 4688: Process creation that might involve task scheduling.
- Windows Task Scheduler Logs: Task creation, modification, or deletion.

Linux/macOS:

- Auditd logs: Monitoring for cron job creation or modifications.
- Syslog: Logs related to cron jobs or scheduled tasks.
- File integrity monitoring (FIM): For changes to /etc/cron*, /var/spool/cron/*, or user-specific cron jobs.

Containers:
- Container logs: Detection of scheduled tasks or cron jobs within container environments.


Analytic 1 - Look for task execution with unusual parameters.

```(sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" OR sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="linux_auditd" OR sourcetype="syslog") 
| where Image IN ("schtasks.exe", "at.exe", "Taskeng.exe", "cron", "crontab", "systemd-timers")```

#### Container: Container Creation (DS0032): 
Monitor for newly constructed containers that may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

Analytic 1 - Look for new container creation events with unusual parameters.

```index=container_logs sourcetype="docker_events" OR sourcetype="kubernetes_events"
| eval event_action=coalesce(action, status)
| where (event_action="create" OR event_action="start")
| search event_type="container"
| search (parameters="*--privileged*" OR parameters="*--cap-add=*" OR parameters="*--volume=*" OR parameters="*--network=host*" OR parameters="*--device*") ```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

Analytic 1 - Look for task scheduling commands being executed with unusual parameters.

```index=security (sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="linux_secure" OR sourcetype="macos_secure" OR sourcetype="container_logs")
| eval CommandLine = coalesce(CommandLine, process)
| where (sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" AND EventCode IN (4697, 4702, 4698)) OR
       (sourcetype="linux_secure" AND CommandLine LIKE "%cron%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%at%") OR
       (sourcetype="macos_secure" AND CommandLine LIKE "%launchctl%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%cron%") OR
       (sourcetype="container_logs" AND (CommandLine LIKE "%cron%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%at%"))
| where (sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" AND (CommandLine LIKE "%/create%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%/delete%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%/change%")) OR
       (sourcetype="linux_secure" AND (CommandLine LIKE "%-f%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%-m%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%--env%")) OR
       (sourcetype="macos_secure" AND (CommandLine LIKE "%/Library/LaunchDaemons%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%/Library/LaunchAgents%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%/System/Library/LaunchDaemons%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%/System/Library/LaunchAgents%")) OR
       (sourcetype="container_logs" AND (CommandLine LIKE "%-f%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%--schedule%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%--env%")) ```

#### File: File Modification (DS0022): 
Monitor for changes made to files that may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

Analytic 1 - Look for task file modifications with unusual parameters.

```index=security_logs OR index=system_logs
(sourcetype="docker_events" OR sourcetype="kubernetes_events" OR sourcetype="wineventlog:security" OR sourcetype="linux_secure" OR sourcetype="syslog" OR sourcetype="file_monitoring")
| eval platform=case(
    sourcetype=="docker_events" OR sourcetype=="kubernetes_events", "Containers",
    sourcetype=="wineventlog:security", "Windows",
    sourcetype=="linux_secure" OR sourcetype=="syslog", "Linux",
    sourcetype=="mac_os_events", "macOS"
)
| search (
    (platform="Containers" AND (event_type="file_modify" AND (file_path="*/etc/cron.d/*" OR file_path="*/etc/systemd/system/*" OR file_path="/etc/crontab"))) OR
    (platform="Windows" AND EventCode=4663 AND (ObjectName="C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\*" OR ObjectName="C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\*")) OR
    (platform="Linux" AND (file_path="/etc/cron.d/*" OR file_path="/etc/systemd/system/*" OR file_path="/etc/crontab")) OR
    (platform="macOS" AND (file_path="/Library/LaunchDaemons/*" OR file_path="/Library/LaunchAgents/*"))
) ```
