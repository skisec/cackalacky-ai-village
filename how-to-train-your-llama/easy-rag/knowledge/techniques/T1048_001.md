# Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.001)

## Description
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. 

Symmetric encryption algorithms are those that use shared or the same keys/secrets on each end of the channel. This requires an exchange or pre-arranged agreement/possession of the value used to encrypt and decrypt data. 

Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged, but adversaries may opt to manually share keys and implement symmetric cryptographic algorithms (ex: RC4, AES) vice using mechanisms that are baked into a protocol. This may result in multiple layers of encryption (in protocols that are natively encrypted such as HTTPS) or encryption in protocols that not typically encrypted (such as HTTP or FTP). 

## Parent Technique
- Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)

## Tactics
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

## Mitigations
- Filter Network Traffic (M1037)
- Network Intrusion Prevention (M1031)
- Network Segmentation (M1030)

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. 

Artifacts and evidence of symmetric key exchange may be recoverable by analyzing network traffic or looking for hard-coded values within malware. If recovered, these keys can be used to decrypt network data from command and control channels. 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor for encrypted payloads using symmetric cryptography over plaintext channels, detection of RC4, AES, or Blowfish in network traffic, or HTTP, FTP, or DNS packets containing unusually long Base64 or XOR-encoded strings.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Encrypted Payloads in Alternative Protocols

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_http.log" OR source="dns.log")
| where (uri_length > 200 OR request_body_length > 5000)
| eval encoded_data=if(match(uri, "([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,})") OR match(request_body, "([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,})"), 1, 0)
| where encoded_data=1
| stats count by _time, host, user, uri, request_body_length, risk_score
| eval risk_score=case(
    request_body_length > 10000, 9,
    request_body_length > 5000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, uri, request_body_length, risk_score```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor for execution of encryption-related tools before outbound data transfer, use of symmetric encryption algorithms (AES, RC4, Blowfish) in scripts or binaries, or file encryption activity followed by network communication.

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("openssl enc -aes-256-cbc", "gpg -c", "python -c 'import Crypto.Cipher.AES'", "certutil -encode"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("openssl enc -aes-256-cbc", "gpg -c"), 9,
    command IN ("python -c 'import Crypto.Cipher.AES'", "certutil -encode"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for files being encrypted before transfer, temporary storage of encrypted files before exfiltration, or files with unusual extensions indicative of encryption (.aes, .enc, .bin).

Analytic 1 - Detecting Encrypted Files Before Exfiltration 

``` (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/tmp/*", "/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil") AND file_extension IN ("aes", "enc", "bin"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_extension="aes" OR file_extension="enc", 9,
    file_extension="bin", 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, file_extension, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for outbound network connections using traditionally non-encrypted protocols, connections where data sent is significantly larger than data received, traffic spikes over uncommon ports (e.g., FTP, SMB, SMTP, ICMP), or traffic patterns indicative of encrypted payload transmission.

    total_bytes > 50000000, 8

| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, dest_port, risk_score```
