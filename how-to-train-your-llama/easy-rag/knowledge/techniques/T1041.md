# Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)

## Description
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel. Stolen data is encoded into the normal communications channel using the same protocol as command and control communications.

## Tactics
- Exfiltration (TA0010)

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel.

Analytic 1 - Detecting C2 Tool Execution Related to Exfiltration

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("powershell -enc", "python -c", "curl -d", "wget --post-file", "certutil -encode", "base64 -w 0"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("powershell -enc", "certutil -encode"), 9,
    command IN ("python -c", "curl -d"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for suspicious files (i.e. .pdf, .docx, .jpg, etc.) viewed in isolation that may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel. 

Analytic 1 - Detecting File Access Before C2 Exfiltration

```(EventCode=11 OR EventCode=4663 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="open")
| where (file_path IN ("/tmp/*", "/var/tmp/*", "/home/*/Downloads/*", "C:\\Users\\*\\Documents\\exfil"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_path IN ("/tmp/*", "/var/tmp/*"), 9,
    file_path IN ("/home/*/Downloads/*"), 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_path, risk_score ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts. 

Note: Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on TCP network connection creation.  

Analytic 1 - Detecting Outbound Network Connections for C2 Exfiltration 

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (bytes_out > 1000000 AND bytes_out > bytes_in * 5) // High outbound traffic
| bucket span=1h _time
| stats count by _time, host, process, dest_ip, bytes_out
| where count > 5
| stats count by host, dest_ip, count, earliest(_time), latest(_time)
| where count >= 5
| eval risk_score=case(
    count >= 10, 9,
    count >= 5, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, count, earliest, latest, risk_score``` 

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Hidden or encoded data inside normal C2 traffic (e.g., Base64, XOR, custom encoding).
HTTP/S payloads with unusual long strings in GET/POST requests.
DNS tunneling techniques used to bypass security controls.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Encoded or Hidden Data in C2 Channels

```(EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_http.log" OR source="dns.log")
| where (uri_length > 200 OR request_body_length > 5000)
| eval encoded_data=if(match(uri, "([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,})") OR match(request_body, "([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,})"), 1, 0)
| where encoded_data=1
| stats count by _time, host, user, uri, request_body_length, risk_score
| eval risk_score=case(
    request_body_length > 10000, 9,
    request_body_length > 5000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, uri, request_body_length, risk_score ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.
