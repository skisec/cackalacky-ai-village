# Gather Victim Network Information (T1590)

## Description
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's networks that can be used during targeting. Information about networks may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: IP ranges, domain names, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its topology and operations.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning (T1595) or Phishing for Information (T1598). Information about networks may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Search Open Technical Databases (T1596)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Active Scanning (T1595) or Search Open Websites/Domains (T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: Acquire Infrastructure (T1583) or Compromise Infrastructure (T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: Trusted Relationship (T1199)).

## Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
