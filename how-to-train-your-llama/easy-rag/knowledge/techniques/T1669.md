# Wi-Fi Networks (T1669)

## Description
Adversaries may gain initial access to target systems by connecting to wireless networks. They may accomplish this by exploiting open Wi-Fi networks used by target devices or by accessing secured Wi-Fi networks — requiring Valid Accounts (T1078) — belonging to a target organization. Establishing a connection to a Wi-Fi access point requires a certain level of proximity to both discover and maintain a stable network connection. 

Adversaries may establish a wireless connection through various methods, such as by physically positioning themselves near a Wi-Fi network to conduct close access operations. To bypass the need for physical proximity, adversaries may attempt to remotely compromise nearby third-party systems that have both wired and wireless network connections available (i.e., dual-homed systems). These third-party compromised devices can then serve as a bridge to connect to a target’s Wi-Fi network.

Once an initial wireless connection is achieved, adversaries may leverage this access for follow-on activities in the victim network or further targeting of specific devices on the network. Adversaries may perform Network Sniffing (T1040) or Adversary-in-the-Middle (T1557) activities for Credential Access (TA0006) or Discovery (TA0007).

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent to or received by abnormal or untrusted hosts.

#### Firewall: Firewall Rule Modification (DS0018): 
Monitor for changes made to firewall rules for unexpected modifications to allow specific network traffic that may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to move laterally.
