# Input Injection (T1674)

## Description
Adversaries may simulate keystrokes on a victimâ€™s computer by various means to perform any type of action on behalf of the user, such as launching the command interpreter using keyboard shortcuts,  typing an inline script to be executed, or interacting directly with a GUI-based application.  These actions can be preprogrammed into adversary tooling or executed through physical devices such as Human Interface Devices (HIDs).

For example, adversaries have used tooling that monitors the Windows message loop to detect when a user visits bank-specific URLs. If detected, the tool then simulates keystrokes to open the developer console or select the address bar, pastes malicious JavaScript from the clipboard, and executes it - enabling manipulation of content within the browser, such as replacing bank account numbers during transactions.

Adversaries have also used malicious USB devices to emulate keystrokes that launch PowerShell, leading to the download and execution of malware from adversary-controlled servers.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor log files for process execution through command-line and scripting activities. Additionally monitor for various tools launching keystrokes such as PowerShell, AutoHotkey, xdotool, AppleScript, or WScript.

Analytic 1 - Unusual Input Simulators 

``` index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype=sysmon
(NewProcessName="*powershell.exe" OR NewProcessName="*cmd.exe" OR NewProcessName="*bash" OR NewProcessName="*osascript")
| stats earliest(_time) as start_time, latest(_time) as end_time, values(ParentProcessName) as parent, values(CommandLine) as cmd by NewProcessName, user
| where parent="explorer.exe" OR parent="winlogon.exe" OR parent="unknown"
| eval duration = end_time - start_time
| where duration < 10
| table start_time, NewProcessName, cmd, parent, user ```

#### Script: Script Execution (DS0012): 
Monitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system that would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent. 

Analytic 1 - Scripts injected via clipboard or keystroke simulation 

``` (index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" EventCode=4104)
OR (index=main sourcetype=sysmon EventCode=1 CommandLine="*osascript*" OR CommandLine="*python*" OR CommandLine="*bash*")
| transaction user maxspan=15s
| join user
    [
        search index=wineventlog sourcetype="WinEventLog:System" (EventCode=400 OR EventCode=20001)
        | search DeviceName="*HID*" OR DeviceName="*Keyboard*"
        | stats count by user, _time, DeviceName
    ]
| table _time, user, CommandLine, DeviceName ```

#### Drive: Drive Creation (DS0016): 
Monitor for newly executed processes when removable media is mounted. Additionally, monitor for unexpected or rapid USB HID enumeration events (e.g., a USB HID device connecting and immediately issuing keystrokes) or anomalies (e.g., a device claiming to be a keyboard but has a suspicious vendor ID) that could indicate a possible rogue device. Tools like Windows Event Logs (e.g., event IDs 20001 - 20003), sysfs on Linux (e.g., `/sys/bus/usb/devices/`), and macOS IORegistry (e.g., `ioreg -p IOUSB`) can provide insight into input devices.

Additionally, consider leveraging keyboard hook APIs to monitor for keystrokes that are too fast and too uniform (e.g., a script executing keystrokes with no human variation or that are too precise). 

Analytic 1 Detect HID like Device Injection 

``` index=wineventlog sourcetype="WinEventLog:System" EventCode=400 OR EventCode=20001
| eval usb_device=coalesce(UsbDevice, DeviceName)
| search usb_device="*keyboard*" OR usb_device="*HID*"
| transaction usb_device maxspan=30s
| join usb_device
    [
      search index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" (EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=4104)
      | stats count by usb_device, _time, CommandLine, ParentProcessName, NewProcessName
    ]
| where count > 0
| table _time, usb_device, NewProcessName, CommandLine, ParentProcessName
```
