# SID-History Injection (T1134.005)

## Description
Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens.  An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute , allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).

With Domain Administrator (or equivalent) rights, harvested or well-known SID values  may be inserted into SID-History to enable impersonation of arbitrary users/groups such as Enterprise Administrators. This manipulation may result in elevated access to local resources and/or access to otherwise inaccessible domains via lateral movement techniques such as Remote Services (T1021), SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002), or Windows Remote Management (T1021.006).

## Parent Technique
- Access Token Manipulation (T1134)

## Tactics
- Defense Evasion (TA0005)
- Privilege Escalation (TA0004)

## Mitigations
- Active Directory Configuration (M1015)

## Detection
Examine data in user’s SID-History attributes using the PowerShell ```Get-ADUser``` cmdlet , especially users who have SID-History values from the same domain.  Also monitor account management events on Domain Controllers for successful and failed changes to SID-History.  

Monitor for Windows API calls to the ```DsAddSidHistory``` function. 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Active Directory: Active Directory Object Modification (DS0026): 
Monitor for changes to account management events on Domain Controllers for successful and failed changes to SID-History.  

#### Process: OS API Execution (DS0009): 
Monitor for API calls, such as PowerShell's Get-ADUser cmdlet or Windows API DsAddSidHistory function,  to examine data in user’s SID-History attributes, especially users who have SID-History values from the same domain.

#### User Account: User Account Metadata (DS0002): 
Examine data in user’s SID-History attributes
