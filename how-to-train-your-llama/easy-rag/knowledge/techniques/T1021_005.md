# VNC (T1021.005)

## Description
Adversaries may use Valid Accounts (T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC).  VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB (“remote framebuffer”) protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.

VNC differs from Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001) as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software. By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC.

Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands. An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network. Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation.

## Detection
Use of VNC may be legitimate depending on the environment and how it’s used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior using VNC.

On macOS systems ```log show --predicate 'process = "screensharingd" and eventMessage contains "Authentication:"'``` can be used to review incoming VNC connection attempts for suspicious activity.

Monitor for use of built-in debugging environment variables (such as those containing credentials or other sensitive information) as well as test/default users on VNC servers, as these can leave openings for adversaries to abuse.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for newly executed processes that may use Valid Accounts (T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). For example, on macOS systems the ```screensharingd``` process may be related to VNC connection activity.

```source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" OR source="/var/log/vncserver.log"
| search parent_process="vncserver" OR parent_process="screensharingd"
| stats count by user, process, parent_process, _time
| eval process_anomaly=if(count > threshold, "suspicious", "normal")
| where process_anomaly="suspicious"
| table _time, user, process, parent_process, process_anomaly```

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor for user accounts logged into systems that may use Valid Accounts (T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). For example, on macOS systems ```log show --predicate 'process = "screensharingd" and eventMessage contains "Authentication:"'``` can be used to review incoming VNC connection attempts for suspicious activity. 

```sourcetype="vnc_logs"
| search message="Authentication succeeded" OR message="Authentication failed"
| stats count by user, src_ip, dest_host, _time
| eval vnc_anomaly=if(count > threshold OR dest_host IN ("critical_hosts"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where vnc_anomaly="suspicious"
| table _time, user, src_ip, dest_host, vnc_anomaly```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections that may use Valid Accounts (T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). Use of VNC may be legitimate depending on the environment and how it’s used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior using VNC. 

``` sourcetype="network_traffic" dest_port=5900 protocol="tcp"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, _time
| eval vnc_connection_anomaly=if(count > threshold OR src_ip IN ("untrusted_ips"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where vnc_connection_anomaly="suspicious"
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, vnc_connection_anomaly```
