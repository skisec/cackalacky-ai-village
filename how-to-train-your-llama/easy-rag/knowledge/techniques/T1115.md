# Clipboard Data (T1115)

## Description
Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications. 

For example, on Windows adversaries can access clipboard data by using ```clip.exe``` or ```Get-Clipboard```. Additionally, adversaries may monitor then replace usersâ€™ clipboard with their data (e.g., Transmitted Data Manipulation (T1565.002)).

macOS and Linux also have commands, such as ```pbpaste```, to grab clipboard contents.

## Detection
Access to the clipboard is a legitimate function of many applications on an operating system. If an organization chooses to monitor for this behavior, then the data will likely need to be correlated against other suspicious or non-user-driven activity.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: OS API Execution (DS0009): 
Monitor API calls that could collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments to collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.
