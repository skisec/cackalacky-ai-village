# Hypervisor CLI (T1059.012)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse hypervisor command line interpreters (CLIs) to execute malicious commands. Hypervisor CLIs typically enable a wide variety of functionality for managing both the hypervisor itself and the guest virtual machines it hosts. 

For example, on ESXi systems, tools such as `esxcli` and `vim-cmd` allow administrators to configure firewall rules and log forwarding on the hypervisor, list virtual machines, start and stop virtual machines, and more. Adversaries may be able to leverage these tools in order to support further actions, such as File and Directory Discovery (T1083) or Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486).

## Parent Technique
- Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)

## Tactics
- Execution (TA0002)

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor command-line arguments made using hypervisor CLIs. Actions may be related to network and system information discovery, collection, or other post-compromise behaviors. On ESXi systems, monitor logs such as `/var/log/shell.log` to track executed commands.
