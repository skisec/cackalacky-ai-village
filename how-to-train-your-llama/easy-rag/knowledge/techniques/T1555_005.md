# Password Managers (T1555.005)

## Description
Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers. Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk.

Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory. Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via Exploitation for Credential Access (T1212).
 Adversaries may also try brute forcing via Password Guessing (T1110.001) to obtain the master password of a password manager.

## Detection
Consider monitoring API calls, file read events, and processes for suspicious activity that could indicate searching in process memory of password managers. 

Consider monitoring file reads surrounding known password manager applications.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Access (DS0009): 
Monitor process being accessed that may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized process access indicating credential searches in password managers.

``` index=security sourcetype IN ("WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational", "linux_secure", "macos_secure") EventCode IN (1, 10, 11)
(Image IN ("*keepass*", "*lastpass*", "*1password*", "*bitwarden*", "*dashlane*", "*passwordsafe*") OR TargetImage IN ("*keepass*", "*lastpass*", "*1password*", "*bitwarden*", "*dashlane*", "*passwordsafe*"))```

#### Process: OS API Execution (DS0009): 
Monitor for API calls that may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.

Analytic 1 - Suspicious API calls related to password manager access.

``` index=security sourcetype IN ("WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational", "linux_secure", "macos_secure") EventCode IN (1, 11, 4688)
(api IN ("CryptUnprotectData", "OpenProcess", "ReadProcessMemory", "EnumProcesses", "EnumProcessModules") OR CommandLine IN ("*keepass*", "*lastpass*", "*1password*", "*bitwarden*", "*dashlane*", "*passwordsafe*")) ```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor file reads that may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.

Analytic 1 - Unauthorized access to password manager files.

``` index=security sourcetype IN ("WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational", "linux_secure", "macos_secure") EventCode IN (1, 4663)
(file_path IN ("*\\AppData\\Local\\Keepass\\*.kdbx", "*\\AppData\\Local\\LastPass\\*.lpvault", "*\\AppData\\Local\\1Password\\*.agilekeychain", "*\\AppData\\Local\\Bitwarden\\*.json", "*\\AppData\\Local\\Dashlane\\*.db", "*\\AppData\\Local\\PasswordSafe\\*.psafe3", "/home/*/.keepass/*.kdbx", "/home/*/.lastpass/*.lpvault", "/home/*/.1password/*.agilekeychain", "/home/*/.bitwarden/*.json", "/home/*/.dashlane/*.db", "/home/*/.passwordsafe/*.psafe3"))```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers. 

Analytic 1 - Commands indicating credential searches in password managers.

``` index=security sourcetype IN ("linux_secure", "macos_secure")
(CommandLine IN ("*keepass*", "*lastpass*", "*1password*", "*bitwarden*", "*dashlane*", "*passwordsafe*", "*login*", "*vault*"))```
