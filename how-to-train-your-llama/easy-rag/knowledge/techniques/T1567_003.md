# Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites (T1567.003)

## Description
Adversaries may exfiltrate data to text storage sites instead of their primary command and control channel. Text storage sites, such as ```pastebin[.]com```, are commonly used by developers to share code and other information.  

Text storage sites are often used to host malicious code for C2 communication (e.g., Stage Capabilities (T1608)), but adversaries may also use these sites to exfiltrate collected data. Furthermore, paid features and encryption options may allow adversaries to conceal and store data more securely.

**Note:** This is distinct from Exfiltration to Code Repository (T1567.001), which highlight access to code repositories via APIs.

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze network traffic for exfiltration attempts using text storage sites, i.e. POST requests to text storage sites, Base64 or other obfuscated data within outbound web requests, or unusual user-agent strings indicating API-based exfiltration.'

``` (EventCode=3 OR source="zeek_http.log" OR source="firewall_logs")
| where (dest_domain LIKE "*.pastebin.com" OR dest_domain LIKE "*.hastebin.com" OR dest_domain LIKE "*.rentry.co" OR dest_domain LIKE "*.ghostbin.com")
| where (http_method="POST")
| stats count, sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, user, dest_domain, user_agent
| where total_bytes > 500000
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 10000000, 9,
    total_bytes > 500000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, user, dest_domain, total_bytes, user_agent, risk_score``` 

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows, specifically to text storage sites such as `Pastebin[.]com`, `Paste[.]ee`, and `Pastebin[.]pl`.
