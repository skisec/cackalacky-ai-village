# Browser Extensions (T1176.001)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems. Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality to and customize aspects of internet browsers. They can be installed directly via a local file or custom URL or through a browser's app store - an official online platform where users can browse, install, and manage extensions for a specific web browser. Extensions generally inherit the web browser's permissions previously granted. 
 
Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores, so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners. Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary-controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions. 
  
Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the ```profiles``` tool to install malicious ```.mobileconfig``` files. In macOS 11+, the use of the ```profiles``` tool can no longer install configuration profiles; however, ```.mobileconfig``` files can be planted and installed with user interaction. 
 
Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence. 

There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions for Command and Control (TA0011). Adversaries may also use browser extensions to modify browser permissions and components, privacy settings, and other security controls for Defense Evasion (TA0005).

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Creation (DS0024): 
Monitor for any new items written to the Registry or PE files written to disk. That may correlate with browser extension installation.

Chrome extension registry keys under: HKCU\Software\Google\Chrome\Extensions
Firefox entries under: HKCU\Software\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions
Unexpected changes or new GUIDs

Analytic 1 - browser registry keys created 

``` sourcetype=WinEventLog:Sysmon EventCode=13
(TargetObject="*\\Software\\Google\\Chrome\\Extensions\\*" OR TargetObject="*\\Software\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Extensions\\*")
| stats count by TargetObject, Details, User, Computer, _time
| sort -_time
```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for execution of chrome.exe, firefox.exe, or edge.exe with arguments like --load-extension, --pack-extension, or --disable-extensions-file-access-check.
Monitor unexpected command-line installs or dev mode extensions

Analytic 1 - browser execution 

``` sourcetype=WinEventLog:Sysmon EventCode=1
(CommandLine="*--load-extension*" OR CommandLine="*--pack-extension*")
| stats count by Image, CommandLine, User, host, _time
| sort -_time
```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments for usage of the profiles tool, such as `profiles install -type=configuration`.

Analytic 1 - Look for command-line activity tied to mobileconfig or extension deployment

``` sourctype=WinEventLog:Sysmon EventCode=1
(CommandLine="*profiles install*" OR CommandLine="*.mobileconfig*" OR CommandLine="*chrome-extension*")
| stats count by CommandLine, Image, ParentImage, User, Computer, _time
| sort -_time
```

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for 
- Newly written .crx, .xpi, or .mobileconfig files
- Modified .plist files under /Library/Managed Preferences/<username>/ (macOS)
- Creation of extensions under:
    - Chrome: AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions
    - Firefox: %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.default\extensions

Analytic 1 - Detect newly written config files 

```sourcetype=WinEventLog:Sysmon EventCode=11
(TargetFilename="*\\Extensions\\*" OR TargetFilename="*.crx" OR TargetFilename="*.xpi" OR TargetFilename="*.mobileconfig")
| stats count by TargetFilename, Image, User, Computer, _time
| sort -_time
 ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts.
