# Automated Collection (T1119)

## Description
Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of a Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. 

In cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, data pipelines, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data. 

This functionality could also be built into remote access tools. 

This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as File and Directory Discovery (T1083) and Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570) to identify and move files, as well as Cloud Service Dashboard (T1538) and Cloud Storage Object Discovery (T1619) to identify resources in cloud environments.

## Detection
Depending on the method used, actions could include common file system commands and parameters on the command-line interface within batch files or scripts. A sequence of actions like this may be unusual, depending on the system and network environment. Automated collection may occur along with other techniques such as Data Staged (T1074). As such, file access monitoring that shows an unusual process performing sequential file opens and potentially copy actions to another location on the file system for many files at once may indicate automated collection behavior. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather data. Data may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047) and PowerShell (T1059.001), as well as through cloud APIs and command line interfaces.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### User Account: User Account Authentication (DS0002): 
Monitor Azure AD (Entra ID) Sign In logs for suspicious Applications authenticating to the Graph API or other sensitive Resources using User Agents attributed to scripting interpreters such as python or Powershell.

Analytic 1 - Suspicious applications, unusual user agents (e.g., python, PowerShell), anomalous IP addresses, and unmanaged devices

``` index="azure_ad_signin_logs" Operation="UserLogin"
| search UserAgent="*python*" OR UserAgent="*PowerShell*"
| stats count by ClientIP, UserId, DeviceProperties
| where ClientIP!="expected_ip" OR DeviceProperties!="expected_properties"```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments for actions that could be taken to collect internal data.

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for unexpected files (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .jpg, etc.) viewed for collecting internal data.

#### Script: Script Execution (DS0012): 
Monitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.
