# Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)

## Description
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.  

Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, or any other network protocol not being used as the main command and control channel. Adversaries may also opt to encrypt and/or obfuscate these alternate channels. 

Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048) can be done using various common operating system utilities such as Net/SMB or FTP. On macOS and Linux ```curl``` may be used to invoke protocols such as HTTP/S or FTP/S to exfiltrate data from a system.

Many IaaS and SaaS platforms (such as Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SharePoint, GitHub, and AWS S3) support the direct download of files, emails, source code, and other sensitive information via the web console or Cloud API (T1059.009).

## Detection
Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage Access (DS0010): 
Monitor for unusual queries to the cloud provider's storage service. Activity originating from unexpected sources may indicate improper permissions are set and are allowing access to data. Additionally, detecting failed attempts by a user for a certain object, followed by escalation of privileges by the same user, and access to the same object may be an indication of suspicious activity.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Suspicious Cloud Storage Exfiltration

```(EventCode="PutObject" OR EventCode="FileSharedExternally" OR source="Google_Admin_Logs")
| where (file_size > 5000000 OR file_access_count > 10)
| stats count by _time, host, user, file_name, action, storage_bucket, file_size
| where count >= 5
| eval risk_score=case(
    file_size > 50000000, 9,
    file_size > 10000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table _time, host, user, file_name, action, storage_bucket, file_size, risk_score ```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Alternative Protocol Exfiltration via Command Execution 

``` (EventCode=1 OR source="/var/log/audit/audit.log" type="execve")
| where (command IN ("scp", "ftp", "curl -d", "wget --post-file", "powershell -enc", "tar -cf", "7z a"))
| eval risk_score=case(
    command IN ("scp", "rsync", "ftp"), 9,
    command IN ("tar -cf", "zip -r"), 8,
    command IN ("powershell -enc", "wget"), 7
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, user, command, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor cloud-based file hosting services, such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, for unusual instances of file downloads â€“ for example, many downloads by a single user in a short period of time. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies. Additionally, data loss prevention policies can be defined to detect and alert on exfiltration events on particularly sensitive data. 

Analytic 1 - Detecting Alternative Exfiltration via Cloud Services

```(EventCode="FileUploaded" OR EventCode="PutObject" OR source="O365_audit" OR source="Google_Admin_Logs")
| where (action IN ("upload", "putObject", "email_sent", "drive_upload"))
| stats count by _time, host, user, action, destination, file_size
| where count >= 3
| eval risk_score=case(
    action IN ("putObject", "FileUploaded") AND file_size > 10000000, 9,
    action IN ("email_sent") AND file_size > 5000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table _time, host, user, action, destination, file_size, risk_score ```

#### File: File Access (DS0022): 
Monitor for suspicious files (i.e. .pdf, .docx, .jpg, etc.) viewed in isolation that may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel.

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for outbound connections using non-standard ports for FTP, SMTP, or SMB, new processes generating large amounts of outbound traffic, or traffic flows that do not align with normal business usage patterns.

| where (dest_port IN (21, 25, 53, 139, 445, 587, 465, 990))
| bucket span=1h _time
| stats count, sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by _time, host, process, dest_ip, dest_port
| where count >= 5 AND total_bytes > 10000000
| eval risk_score=case(
    total_bytes > 50000000, 9,
    total_bytes > 10000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| table host, dest_ip, total_bytes, dest_port, risk_score```
