# Web Portal Capture (T1056.003)

## Description
Adversaries may install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. For example, a compromised login page may log provided user credentials before logging the user in to the service.

This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through External Remote Services (T1133) and Valid Accounts (T1078) or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service.
