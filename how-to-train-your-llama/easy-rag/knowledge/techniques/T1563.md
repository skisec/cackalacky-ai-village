# Remote Service Session Hijacking (T1563)

## Description
Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment. Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP. When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.

Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems. Remote Service Session Hijacking (T1563) differs from use of Remote Services (T1021) because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using Valid Accounts (T1078).

## Sub-techniques
- SSH Hijacking (T1563.001)
- RDP Hijacking (T1563.002)

## Tactics
- Lateral Movement (TA0008)

## Mitigations
- Network Segmentation (M1030)
- Disable or Remove Feature or Program (M1042)
- Password Policies (M1027)
- User Account Management (M1018)
- Privileged Account Management (M1026)

## Detection
Use of these services may be legitimate, depending upon the network environment and how it is used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with that service. Monitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time.

Monitor for processes and command-line arguments associated with hijacking service sessions.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Content (DS0029): 
Monitor network traffic for signs of hijacked sessions, such as unusual traffic patterns or unexpected session resumptions. Identify suspicious remote connections that align with ongoing user sessions.

```sourcetype=flow
| search (dest_port=22 OR dest_port=3389 OR dest_port=23) AND (connection_state="ESTABLISHED")
| eval session_hijack=if(session_duration > threshold_duration AND connection_origin="suspicious_ip", "possible_hijack", "normal")
| where session_hijack="possible_hijack"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, connection_state, _time
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, session_hijack ```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment.

``` (source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688")
| search (command_line="*attach-session*" OR command_line="*tmux attach*" OR command_line="*screen -r*" OR command_line="*rdpwrap*")
| stats count by user, host, parent_process_name, process_name, command_line, _time
| eval hijacking_attempt=if(count > threshold OR match(command_line, "attach|hijack|reconnect"), "suspicious", "normal")
| where hijacking_attempt="suspicious"``` 

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor newly executed processes that may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment.

#### Logon Session: Logon Session Creation (DS0028): 
Monitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time.
