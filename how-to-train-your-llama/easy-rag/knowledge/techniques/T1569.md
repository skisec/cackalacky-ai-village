# System Services (T1569)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. Adversaries can execute malicious content by interacting with or creating services either locally or remotely. Many services are set to run at boot, which can aid in achieving persistence (Create or Modify System Process (T1543)), but adversaries can also abuse services for one-time or temporary execution.

## Sub-techniques
- Systemctl (T1569.003)
- Launchctl (T1569.001)
- Service Execution (T1569.002)

## Tactics
- Execution (TA0002)

## Mitigations
- Privileged Account Management (M1026)
- User Account Management (M1018)
- Behavior Prevention on Endpoint (M1040)
- Restrict File and Directory Permissions (M1022)

## Detection
Monitor for command line invocations of tools capable of modifying services that doesnâ€™t correspond to normal usage patterns and known software, patch cycles, etc. Also monitor for changes to executables and other files associated with services. Changes to Windows services may also be reflected in the Registry.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Modification (DS0024): 
Monitor for changes made to windows registry keys and/or values that may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs.

Analytic 1 - Malicious service modification

```sourcetype= Sysmon EventCode=12
| search registry_path="HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\*" 
| where registry_action="modified" AND user NOT IN ("known_admins") ```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor newly executed processes that may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs.

Analytic 1 - New processes abusing system services.

```sourcetype=process_logs
| search process IN ("services.exe", "systemd", "launchd")
 ```

#### Service: Service Creation (DS0019): 
Track the creation of new services, which could indicate adversarial activity aimed at persistence or execution.

Analytic 1 - Monitors service creation and modification activities

```sourcetype=service_logs
| search service_action="create" OR service_action="modify"
| where user NOT IN ("known_admins") AND service_name NOT IN ("known_services")
```

#### File: File Modification (DS0022): 
Track changes to critical service-related files (e.g., ```/etc/systemd/system/```, ```/etc/init.d/```, and service binaries on Linux, ```C:\Windows\System32\services.exe``` on Windows, or ```/Library/LaunchDaemons``` on macOS).

Analytic 1 - Unusual file modifications related to system services.

```sourcetype=file_monitor
| search file_path IN ("/etc/systemd/system/*", "/etc/init.d/*", "/Library/LaunchDaemons/*", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\services.exe")
 ```

#### Command: Command Execution (DS0017): 
Monitor command-line invocations for tools capable of creating or modifying system services (e.g., ```systemctl``` on Linux, ```sc.exe``` on Windows, ```launchctl``` on macOS).

Analytic 1 - Unusual service modification tools.

``` sourcetype=command_logs
| search command IN ("systemctl", "sc", "launchctl")
```
