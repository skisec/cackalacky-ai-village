# Exploitation for Credential Access (T1212)

## Description
Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.Â 

Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain authenticated access to systems. One example of this is `MS14-068`, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions. Another example of this is replay attacks, in which the adversary intercepts data packets sent between parties and then later replays these packets. If services don't properly validate authentication requests, these replayed packets may allow an adversary to impersonate one of the parties and gain unauthorized access or privileges.

Such exploitation has been demonstrated in cloud environments as well. For example, adversaries have exploited vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure that allowed for unintended authentication token creation and renewal.

Exploitation for credential access may also result in Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained.

## Tactics
- Credential Access (TA0006)

## Mitigations
- Exploit Protection (M1050)
- Update Software (M1051)
- Application Developer Guidance (M1013)
- Threat Intelligence Program (M1019)
- Application Isolation and Sandboxing (M1048)

## Detection
Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash. Also look for behavior on the system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of processes. Credential resources obtained through exploitation may be detectable in use if they are not normally used or seen.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### User Account: User Account Authentication (DS0002): 
Credential resources obtained through exploitation may be detectable in use if they are not normally used or seen.

Analytic 1 - High number of failed authentication attempts or unusual logon patterns.

``` (index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode IN (4625, 4648)) OR 
(index=os sourcetype="linux_secure" message="Failed password") OR 
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" message="Failed to authenticate user")```

#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
Monitor for newly executed processes that may indicate attempts to exploit vulnerabilities for credential access.

Analytic 1 - Unexpected process creation related to exploitation tools or techniques.

``` (index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4688) OR 
(index=security sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1) OR 
(index=os sourcetype="linux_secure" action="execve") OR 
(index=os sourcetype="macos_secure" event_type="execve") | where match(Image, "(?i)(msfconsole|metasploit|mimikatz|powersploit|empire|cobaltstrike|responder|kerberoast|john|hashcat|rcrack|hydra|medusa|ncrack|patator)")```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash.
