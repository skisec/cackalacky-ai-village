# Hardware Additions (T1200)

## Description
Adversaries may physically introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage (i.e. Replication Through Removable Media (T1091)), more robust hardware additions can be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can then be abused.

While public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many red teams/penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. Commercial and open source products can be leveraged with capabilities such as passive network tapping, network traffic modification (i.e. Adversary-in-the-Middle (T1557)), keystroke injection, kernel memory reading via DMA, addition of new wireless access points to an existing network, and others.

## Tactics
- Initial Access (TA0001)

## Mitigations
- Limit Access to Resource Over Network (M1035)
- Limit Hardware Installation (M1034)

## Detection
Asset management systems may help with the detection of computer systems or network devices that should not exist on a network. 

Endpoint sensors may be able to detect the addition of hardware via USB, Thunderbolt, and other external device communication ports.

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Unauthorized Network Devices

```(EventCode=10400)
OR (source="/var/log/syslog" "new MAC address detected")
OR (source="firewall_logs" "DHCP Lease Granted" mac_address NOT IN (trusted_macs))
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(mac_address, "%00:0C:29%"), 8,
    like(mac_address, "%Unknown%"), 9,
    like(mac_address, "%RaspberryPi%"), 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, mac_address, ip_address, risk_score ```

#### Drive: Drive Creation (DS0016): 
Monitor for newly constructed drives or other related events associated with computer hardware and other accessories (especially new or unknown) being connected to systems. Endpoint sensors may be able to detect the addition of hardware via USB, Thunderbolt, and other external device communication ports.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Unauthorized External Drives 

``` (EventCode=4663 OR EventCode=11)
OR (source="/var/log/messages" OR source="/var/log/syslog" "block device added")
OR (source="macOS_logs" Event="com.apple.diskarbitrationd")
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(DeviceName, "%Kingston%"), 7,
    like(DeviceName, "%SanDisk%"), 6,
    like(DeviceName, "%Unknown%"), 9
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, DeviceName, user, risk_score```

#### Application Log: Application Log Content (DS0015): 
Monitor new external hardware devices connected to a system (USB, Thunderbolt, PCIe), unauthorized HID (Human Interface Device) injections simulating keyboard/mouse inputs, unusual kernel-level access from attached devices (e.g., DMA attacks), or execution of suspicious processes upon device connection.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Unauthorized USB or Thunderbolt Devices

``` (EventCode=6416) 
OR (source="/var/log/messages" OR source="/var/log/syslog" "usb" OR "thunderbolt")
OR (source="sysmon" EventCode=1 Image="C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe" CommandLine="*usb*")
| eval risk_score=case(
    like(DeviceID, "%BadUSB%"), 8,
    like(DeviceID, "%RubberDucky%"), 9,
    like(DeviceID, "%LanTap%"), 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, DeviceID, user, risk_score```
