# IDE Tunneling (T1219.001)

## Description
Adversaries may abuse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software with remote development features to establish an interactive command and control channel on target systems within a network. IDE tunneling combines SSH, port forwarding, file sharing, and debugging into a single secure connection, letting developers work on remote systems as if they were local. Unlike SSH and port forwarding, IDE tunneling encapsulates an entire session and may use proprietary tunneling protocols alongside SSH, allowing adversaries to blend in with legitimate development workflows. Some IDEs, like Visual Studio Code, also provide CLI tools (e.g., `code tunnel`) that adversaries may use to programmatically establish tunnels and generate web-accessible URLs for remote access. These tunnels can be authenticated through accounts such as GitHub, enabling the adversary to control the compromised system via a legitimate developer portal.

Additionally, adversaries may use IDE tunneling for persistence. Some IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code and JetBrains, support automatic reconnection. Adversaries may configure the IDE to auto-launch at startup, re-establishing the tunnel upon execution. Compromised developer machines may also be exploited as jump hosts to move further into the network.

IDE tunneling tools may be built-in or installed as IDE Extensions (T1176.002).

## Detection

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Process: Process Creation (DS0009): 
On Windows, monitor for executions of `code.exe` with arguments such as `tunnel`, `--remote`, or `--host`. On macOS, monitor processes like `code` or `jetbrains-gateway` launched with similar remote access flags. On Linux, track the execution of code, `jetbrains-gateway`, or `ssh` with tunneling options like `-R`, `-L`, or `-D`. These process-creation events can indicate attempts to establish remote tunnels through IDEs.

Analytic 1 - Detect interactive remote access session initiated by IDE

``` sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1
(Image="*\\code.exe" OR Image="*/code" OR Image="*/jetbrains-gateway*" OR Image="*/ssh")
(CommandLine="*tunnel*" OR CommandLine="*--remote*" OR CommandLine="*-R*" OR CommandLine="*-L*" OR CommandLine="*-D*")
| table _time, host, user, Image, CommandLine, ParentImage
| sort _time desc
```

#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Network traffic directed to `*.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com` or `*.devtunnels.ms` indicate that a system is attempting to initiate or maintain a Visual Studio Code remote tunnel.

Analytic 1 - Detect active IDE tunnel to VSCode or JetBrains cloud relay 

``` sourcetype="stream:http" OR sourcetype="stream:tcp"
(dest_domain="*.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com" OR dest_domain="*.devtunnels.ms")
| stats count by _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_domain, uri_path
| sort _time desc
```

#### File: File Creation (DS0022): 
Monitor for the creation of the file `code_tunnel.json` within the `.vscode-cli` directory in a user's home profile (`~/.vscode-cli/code_tunnel.json` on Linux/macOS or `%UserProfile%\.vscode-cli\code_tunnel.json` on Windows), which signals a Visual Studio Code tunnel has been established.

Analytic 1 - Monitor for active or persistent VS Code Tunnel 

```sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=11
(file_path="*\\.vscode-cli\\code_tunnel.json" OR file_path="*/.vscode-cli/code_tunnel.json")
| stats min(_time) as creation_time by host, user, file_path
| sort creation_time
 ```
