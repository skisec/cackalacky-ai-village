# Traffic Duplication (T1020.001)

## Description
Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised infrastructure. Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, often used for network analysis. For example, devices may be configured to forward network traffic to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device. 

Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other infrastructure they control. Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through ROMMONkit (T1542.004) or Patch System Image (T1601.001).

Many cloud-based environments also support traffic mirroring. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.

Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with Network Sniffing (T1040), Input Capture (T1056), or Adversary-in-the-Middle (T1557) depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary.

## Detection
Monitor network traffic for uncommon data flows (e.g. unusual network communications, suspicious communications that have never been seen before, communications sending fixed size data packets at regular intervals).  Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. 

### Detailed Detection by Data Source/Component
#### Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation (DS0029): 
Monitor for creation of unauthorized traffic mirroring sessions, unexpected outbound network connections from routers or cloud instances, configuration changes in network devices related to traffic forwarding or unusual new network flows, particularly on ports associated with traffic analysis tools.

Analytic 1 - Detecting Unauthorized Traffic Mirroring Sessions

``` (EventCode="CreateTrafficMirrorSession" OR EventCode="VirtualNetworkTapCreated" OR source="firewall_logs" message="Mirror Port Config Change")
| eval risk_score=case(
    EventCode="CreateTrafficMirrorSession", 9,
    EventCode="VirtualNetworkTapCreated", 8,
    EventCode="ModifyTrafficMirrorSession", 7
)
| where risk_score >= 7
| stats count by _time, host, user, EventCode, risk_score```

#### Network Traffic: Network Traffic Flow (DS0029): 
Monitor and analyze network flows associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, or gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns). Consider analyzing newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts, unexpcted hardware devices, or other uncommon data flows.

``` (source="zeek_conn.log" OR source="firewall_logs" OR source="cloud_network_logs")
| where (flow_type="asymmetric" OR flow_type="mirrored")
| where (dest_port IN (4789, 4790, 8000, 5000) OR bytes_out > 10000000)
| eval risk_score=case(
    flow_type="asymmetric" AND dest_port IN (4789, 4790), 9,
    flow_type="mirrored" AND bytes_out > 10000000, 8
)
| where risk_score >= 8
| stats count by _time, host, source_ip, dest_ip, bytes_out, risk_score```
