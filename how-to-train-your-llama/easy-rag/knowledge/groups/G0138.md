Andariel (G0138) has primarily focused its operations--which have included destructive attacks--against South Korean government agencies, military organizations, and a variety of domestic companies; they have also conducted cyber financial operations against ATMs, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges. Andariel (G0138)'s notable activity includes Operation Black Mine, Operation GoldenAxe, and Campaign Rifle.

Andariel (G0138) is considered a sub-set of Lazarus Group (G0032), and has been attributed to North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau.

North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name Lazarus Group (G0032) instead of tracking clusters or subgroups.
