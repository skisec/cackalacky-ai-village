# FIN7 (G0046)

## Description
FIN7 (G0046) is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013. FIN7 (G0046) has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage, transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of FIN7 (G0046) was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale malware for targeting efforts. Since 2020, FIN7 (G0046) shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of REvil ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. FIN7 may be linked to the Carbanak (G0008) Group, but there appears to be several groups using Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately.
