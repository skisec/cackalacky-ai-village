## Description
Gamaredon Group (G0047) is a suspected Russian cyber espionage threat group that has targeted military, NGO, judiciary, law enforcement, and non-profit organizations in Ukraine since at least 2013. The name Gamaredon Group (G0047) comes from a misspelling of the word "Armageddon", which was detected in the adversary's early campaigns.

In November 2021, the Ukrainian government publicly attributed Gamaredon Group (G0047) to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) Center 18.
